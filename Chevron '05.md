## Summary

When Hurricane Katrina made windfall on August 29, a storage tank at the Chevron Empire Terminal ruptured, spilling oil into a retention pond. Because the spill was contained by a retention pond, Chevron claimed the net loss to be zero barrels. On September 24, Hurricane Rita hit Louisiana. Some of the crude that had still remained in the retention pond was blown by this second hurricane in to the neigboring marsh. The response forces later "disposed" of this spill though in situ burning. The $150 million property damage figure that the Chevron submitted (for Katrina), would make it the costliest spill on record, but is difficult to verify. Overall, hurricane Katrina damaged over 400 pipelines and over 100 platforms. Maybe the cost include damage to facilities from the storm, and lost revenue? As of 2019, no fines have been levied against any of the operators, see [[resources|Chevron '05.md#katrina-and-rita]].

## Significance

Very little can be found about the specific spill that occured at the Empire Terminal, both in the news and in government documents. All spills that resulted from Hurricane Katrina added together spilled as much oil as the Exxon Valdez disaster. There is a lack of attention to this spill, which may be because the spill is seen as solely caused by Hurricane Katrina, and overall, the response to Hurricane Katrina in terms of containing oil spills is drawn as positive by the EPA, see [[resources|Chevron '05.md#spill-as-success]]. Certainly, very little can be learned from this spills if it is "swept under the rug". [[LOSCO]] Of note is that the agency in charge of assessing the damages in Louisiana has very little resources available, both in terms of funding and manpower, see [[resources|Chevron '05#15-years-later]]. If we turn this incident on its head, the interpretation of the events as a success imply that major oil spills are seen as an acceptable outcome of a Hurricane. This specific spill, although relatively large and costly, was overshadowed by the offshore spills that occured at the same time. The outcome of the process is that we can say almost with certainty that spills will continue as a result of hurricanes in the area [[resources|Chevron '05#15-years-later]].

## Learning

### Mechanisms
* Diverging claims as to whether pipelines put in place more flood protection in the area as a response (such as higher levees). But the State Bar of Texas (of all actors) points out that spiking oil prices after disasters could motivate operators to floodproof their facilities, see [[resources|Chevron '94#Later-hurricanes]]. 

### Outcomes
* If flood protection is put in place, we would expect lower spill volumes from subsequent hurricanes. However, it is pretty difficult to compare hurricanes and their impact on specific locations. For instance, the Empire Terminal was probably hit by a large object that was carried by the water.
