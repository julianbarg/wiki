## One-paragraph summary
Resources matter. Why? Because resource control provides power over transaction partners. The early literature stated that organizations should identify and attempt to reduce power disadvantages in relationships with other organizations, e.g., by acquiring those partners or reducing dependence on the resources they provide ([[Pfeffer and Salancik 1978]]). Later literature pointed out however that it would be contradictory for the disadvantaged company to be able to directly reduce power imbalance themselves - to do so requires them to hold power (Hillman, Wither and Collins 2009). Recently, a stream of empirical work has also emerged: [[Katila, Rosenberger and Eisenhardt 2008]] for instance found that startups are more likely to enter relationships in which they are potentially disadvantaged if they first developed defense mechanisms (e.g., patents that protect intellectual property).
