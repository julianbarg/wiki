## Learning mechanisms
* "reduced labor requirements" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161) improves efficiency, but could also create slack
* "learning by management leading to more efficient production and labor scheduling and improved production control" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161) improves efficiency and quality of work, could also create slack
* "learning by the engineering department of a firm, which redesigns the capital equipment utilized by workers and makes changes in the operation of the plant to improve routing and handling of material" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161)
* Learning of suppliers ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161). However, this would be controlled for through technology.


Most of these mechanisms either improve quality of work or generate slack.

* Do organizations simultaneously improve efficiency and reliability? How are the two related?

* Slack matters. When organizations improve safety, this means "payments" ([[Cyert and March 1992]], 42]]) could be cut and performance would remain stable (implying an improvement in efficiency - performance over payments). However, the excess payments reveal themselves as "slack" ([[Cyert and March 1992]], 41 f.]]), which is only cut under some circumstances.

* Why would the organization use slack to improve pipeline safety? Because the members have a strong motivation to improve safety (do they?). Safety is a (strongly institutionalized) goal of the pipeline safety department? Unlike the overall work of the overall organization, working on pipeline safety is not stigmatized?
