## Learning mechanisms

### According to [[Joskow and Rozanski (1979)|Joskow and Rozanski 1979]]
* "reduced labor requirements" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161) improves efficiency, but could also create slack
* "learning by management leading to more efficient production and labor scheduling and improved production control" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161) improves efficiency and quality of work, could also create slack
* "learning by the engineering department of a firm, which redesigns the capital equipment utilized by workers and makes changes in the operation of the plant to improve routing and handling of material" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161)
* Learning of suppliers ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161). However, this would be controlled for through technology.
* "identification and correction of particular technical 'bugs'" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161)
* "increasing ability of workers to use and maintain the equipment more effectively" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161). Same time spend to inspect more pipeline miles?
* Supplier producing equipment that "require shorter 'break-in'" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161)


Most of these mechanisms either improve quality of work or generate slack.

* Do organizations simultaneously improve efficiency and reliability? How are the two related?

* Slack matters. When organizations improve safety, this means "payments" ([[Cyert and March 1992]], 42]]) could be cut and performance would remain stable (implying an improvement in efficiency - performance over payments). However, the excess payments reveal themselves as "slack" ([[Cyert and March 1992]], 41 f.]]), which is only cut under some circumstances.

* Why would the organization use slack to improve pipeline safety? Because the members have a strong motivation to improve safety (do they?). Safety is a (strongly institutionalized) goal of the pipeline safety department? Unlike the overall work of the overall organization, working on pipeline safety is not stigmatized?

* An important mechanism seems to be that staff cannot easily be fired when safety has reached a sufficient level (because it is difficult to identify this slack).

---

* All this implies that there could be undetected learning, when a department gets better at managing pipeline safety, performance may improve or be stable (because the pipelines are aging) and slack resources build up that are difficult to measure.

### According to source research

Web resources and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgasworkers/comments/e0jltk/any_experience_with_working_on_pipeline_safety/]]

Safety professionals supervise the construction of pipelines and (may) attempt to enforce regulations, but primarily try to avoid injuries and deaths (or cover their asses). Safety personnel is associated in this order (1) with classic *health and safety* of the personnel, (2) with certifying/skills/education, and finally (3) *reporting* (**!**) oil spills and incidents.

### According to learning from disaster literature

Organizations experience disasters and attempt to avoid future disasters. "[D]isasters call into question the social legitimacy and continues societal sanctioning of hazardous organizations, industries, and technologies" ([[Madsen|Madsen 2009]] 2009, 862). High-profile disasters are thus much more impactful than smaller ones, as described in the literature ([[Shrivastava 1987]]; [[Vaughan 1996]]; [[Snook 2002]]).

What size makes an incident large enough for the public to respond?

## Ideas

### Complex system

Phenomenon constitutes complex system.

### "Game" or "race"
* Frame it as a "game" or "race". 

One side, "the pipeline", gets constructed inevitably imperfect (although there are probably more and less well-constructed pipelines). The other side (pipeline safety) "races" to find defects before spills happen. Because time is an important factor for translating defects into oil spills.
