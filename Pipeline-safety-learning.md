## Learning mechanisms
* "reduced labor requirements" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161) improves efficiency, but could also create slack
* "learning by management leading to more efficient production and labor scheduling and improved production control" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161) improves efficiency and quality of work, could also create slack
* "learning by the engineering department of a firm, which redesigns the capital equipment utilized by workers and makes changes in the operation of the plant to improve routing and handling of material" ([[Joskow and Rozanski 1979]], 161)


Most of these mechanisms either improve quality of work or generate slack.

Safety is a (strongly institutionalized) goal of the pipeline safety department? Unlike the overall work of the overall organization, working on pipeline safety is not stigmatized?
