## One-paragraph summary

Exploring the process of how in a discursive approach to risk, familiar notions of risks are attached to novel risks. The authors also zoom out [@Nicolini2009] and analysise how the activities of different organizations (in different countries) interact with each other. In the conclusion section, the authors emphasize the nonlinearity of the translation process--because novel risks are unfamiliar, one cannot predict how they will be translated, and different actors will translate them in different ways.
