## One-page summary
Rao (1994) makes a connection between the resource-based view (RBV) and institutional theory (IT). He holds that legitimacy describes "collective processes by which reputation is created" (Rao 1994: 31). Thus, he characterizes legitimacy (adopted from IT) as the precedence of reputation (adopted from RBV). Further, Rao explains that companies still need to signal their reputation. Therefore, an agentic act is taking place as well when companies yield reputation to improve their performance. 

Finally, Rao explains that companies are not trapped in an "iron cage" of structure, as DiMaggio and Powell (1983) already theorized. Allow me to remind you that DiMaggio and Powell tried to bridge agency and structure by laying out that agentic actors will tend to select popularized practices as a way to gain legitimacy and thus resources. In his discussion section, Rao instead asserts that "Culture becomes a tool kit or a menu from which actors choose options" (Rao 1994: 41). Further, he identifies entrepreneurs as actors who can change the field. When the field is saturated, they attempt to attain legitimacy for innovative practices at the periphery. Entrepreneurs’ success might vow field incumbents to adopt the entrepreneurs’ practices. Thus, institutional processes can contribute to change in the field, rather than damning a field to be static. 

While Rao does make many connections between legitimacy and reputation, he leaves open to some extend whether the two may be the same. He holds that reputation rests in signals, whereas legitimacy "flows from symbols" (Rao 1994: 30). In other words, companies need to signal their reputation to their audience through the use of signals. But in order to be able to signal reputation, they rely on credible use of collectively legitimated symbols. The difference might be semantic in nature, rather than constituting two separate constructs. 

Rao includes a statistical test in his paper that exemplifies well his new conceptualization of legitimacy and reputation. He holds that much of the previous literature is prone to false positives, because legitimacy allows for access to resources and subsequently allow for better performance at a later date. In other words, because legitimacy is an antecedence of performance, its validity cannot be tested by analyzing the effect of legitimacy on performance. Rao instead studies the early car industry, where reliable information on different producers was not easily accessible for the audience. Here, Rao finds that companies that companies which perform well in contests (e.g., races) have a lower exit rate. This evidence suggests, according to Rao, that "certification contests are credentialing mechanisms that invest organizations with cognitive validity" (Rao 1994: 30).
