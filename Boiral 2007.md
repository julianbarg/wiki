# @Boiral2007

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]], [[Constructivism & Ecology]]_

* Université Laval, Québec
* 9 companies, 72 interviews

## One-paragraph summary

@Boiral2007 studies 9 companies' implementation of ISO 14001. He finds that while there is no evidence of significant environmental progress, the implementation of ISO allowed the companies to adopt the language of rationality and environmental sustainability. The implementation occured mostly in the form of documents, with relatively little impact on day-to-day activities. It created a tangible independent structure, independent from the actual structure of the organization. The author also shows that the structure is only activated when either quarterly reports need to be produced, or ahead of certification audits [@Boiral2007, p. 138].
