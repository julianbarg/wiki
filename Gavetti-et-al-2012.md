## One-paragraph summary

BTOF builds on assumption of bounded rationality, individuals' attempts at rational decision making that are influenced by organizations. For instance, decision makers do not maximize; instead, their actions involve satisficing, search, and rules/schemes. In particular, understanding search is crucial: individuals choose from the options they are aware of; if there is no option available that may allow them to meet their aspiration level, they may engage in search; and "[s]earch processes stop when an alternative is expected to be satisfactory" (ibid., 5). The authors reemphasize the inability of organizations to fully resolve goal conflicts (ibid., 5f.).

On routines, the authors draw a line from Nelson and Winter (1982) to Levitt and March (1988). They propose that routines hold the key to organizational performance; an organization achieves good performance when it responds "local, short term, regular feedback" (ibid., 8), and adjusts operating routines accordingly.
