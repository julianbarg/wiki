## One-paragraph summary

The original premise of [[BTOF]] is that decision making is central to behavioral theory, and therefore BTOF should be based on the logic and psychology of human choice (ibid., 3). Concretely, (1) humans satisfice instead of maximize, (2) they engage in search only under certain circumstances, and (3) their behavior in organizations is often guided by "*[r]ules,standard operating procedures, and status quo*" (ibid., 5; emphasis in original). Among the four central "relational concepts" of Cyert and March (1963) is *learning* (the others are (1) quasi-resolution of conflict, (2) uncertainty avoidance, and (3) problematistic search). There are six reserach themes on BTOF right 

* Evolutionary economics
* Organizatoinal learning
* Dynamic capabilities
* Attention-Based-View
* Cognition

Learning, according to Gavetti et al. (2010)

## Important points
* Learning is a reoccurring topic in the article.
* There are six research themes on [[BTOF]] right now: cognition, performance feedback, politics, attention, learning, and adaption.

## One-page summary

BTOF builds on assumption of bounded rationality, individuals' attempts at rational decision making that are influenced by organizations. For instance, decision makers do not maximize; instead, their actions involve satisficing, search, and rules/schemes. In particular, understanding search is crucial: individuals choose from the options they are aware of; if there is no option available that may allow them to meet their aspiration level, they may engage in search; and "[s]earch processes stop when an alternative is expected to be satisfactory" (ibid., 5). The authors reemphasize the inability of organizations to fully resolve goal conflicts (ibid., 5f.).

On routines, the authors draw a line from Nelson and Winter (1982) to Levitt and March (1988). They propose that routines hold the key to organizational performance; an organization achieves good performance when it responds "local, short term, regular feedback" (ibid., 8), and adjusts operating routines accordingly.

Summary of learning:

"The Behavioral Theory of the Firm saw learning as a relational concept that included reinforcement of attention rules and search paths that proved successful in generating solutions (Cyert & March, 1963, pp. 123–125). However, a later article opened this view to also include learning from the external sources such as the experience of other organizations (Levitt & March, 1988)" (ibid., 16 f.).

Topics covered related to learning:

* Myopic search
* Networks
* Attributes of knowledge - interdependence, tacitness

They state that one understudied area is integration, relevant for me might be *multiple goals*. Also called "plurality of goals". Overall, Gavetti et al. (2012) calls for the creation of a behavioral theory of inter- and intra-organizational behavior.
