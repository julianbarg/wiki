The Sandhills are a region in Nebraska that is significant for its shallow water table. Residents attest that in many places, you can dig your heel into the sand, and the resulting hole will fill with ground water. The Sandhills sit on top of the critically important [[Ogallala aquifer|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogallala_Aquifer]], which provides water for 27% of irrigated land in the US.
