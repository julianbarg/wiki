## One-page summary
Dynamic Capabilities is a theory of business strategy that builds on three existing theories of competing. The first, Competitive Forces, was developed by porter in the 1980s, and provides the five-forces framework, which firms can use to analyze their environment (industry) to gain an advantage. It is based on the idea that the existence of impediments to competition (entry barriers) provides economic rents in selected industries, which firms should take advantage of. The second approach, Strategic Conflict, focuses on the competition between rival firms and introduces game theory into the equation to model moves and countermoves of the competitors. Next, the Resource-based Perspective turned the focus to the internal workings of a firm. It emphasizes the ability of companies to capture rents on the resources of a firm, such as tangible or intangible assets that are not traded on the market (or at least not for market value). 

Before even introducing the Dynamic Capabilities concept, the first major contribution of Teece, Pisano & Shuen (1997) is to compile a list of what the Resource-based View might call resources. Factors of Production are undifferentiated inputs, while *Resources are fairly differentiated firm-specific assets*. Organizational Routines are rather general competences such as quality, miniaturization, and system integration, whereas Core Competences are fundamental competences that are present across the firm. Finally, Dynamic Capabilities are the ability of a firm to quickly reconfigure their competences to adapt to sudden environmental change and garner competitive advantage, and Products are all outcomes of production. Usually, the Products have an imprint of the firms’ competences that determines their success on the market. 

More importantly, the Dynamic Capabilities approach points out that a firm is more than the sum of its parts, as “many distinctive elements of internal organization simply cannot be replicated in the market”(Teece, Pisano & Shuen 1997: 517). In other words, it is what is not in the balance sheets that is what the Dynamic Capabilities approach tries to capture, in addition to the important elements of strategy compiled by preceding authors. Instead, Dynamic Capabilities brings forth four paradigms stemming from two approaches: strategizing and economizing. 

Strategizing includes the Positions and Paths concepts. Positions includes a number of tangible and intangible assets: technological, financial, reputational, structural, institutional, and market assets, and organizational boundaries. These together form the company’s Position which define its competitive advantage at a specific point in time. The Path concept originates in the path dependence concept: where an organization or individual is coming from determines to a large extend where it will go in the future. For instance, specific Technological Opportunities may only be available to certain companies. 

Economizing (Replication and Imitation) represents the bridge between capabilities and the environment. How a company and its competitors perform from a certain point in time forward depends on their ability to replicate or imitate. Replication describes the transfer or redeployment of competences from one area in another. For instance, an organization may be specifically effective at applying insights across multiple contexts, gaining this organization an additional advantage. Imitation represents replication by an outsider. A company can gain an advantage in this field if it can lock out its competitors from imitating its creations, either through intellectual property protection using the legal system or through secrecy. 

Dynamic Capabilities should be studies for its inclusion of the time perspective, and the possibility of dynamic change over time. Most importantly, the authors make the case that a strategic advantage based on resources can dissipate quickly. It still does not represent an empirically founded and systematic theory of business strategy however. Thus, the concept does not constitute a “breakthrough” or “revolution” compared to preceding theories, as the authors acknowledge on pages 510f. by emphasizing the value of studying this theory in conjunction with the preceding theories.
