## One-paragraph summary
Resilience is a concept that originates in the study of social-ecologic systems [[Walker et al 2004]]. Resilient systems have enhanced probability to stay within the basin of attraction of their stability landscape (signifying stability over time). Humans affect all social-ecological systems and can exert significant influence on the development of these systemsâ€”intentionally or unintentionally. Humans have the (in nature) unique ability to intentionally envision and realize different pathways for a social-ecological system. Another factor that affects social-ecological systems are other systems that have a larger or smaller scale. As long as the interaction between systems at different levels is not effected though, systems can experiment and change without affecting one another.
