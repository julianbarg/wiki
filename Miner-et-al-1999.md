## One-paragraph summary

Inductive method in a three step process. From coded failure events, obtain (1) effect of failure on industry, (2) processes involved, and (3) strategic implications. E.g., example of nuclear industry: collective industry action to save the industry.Three types of response to failure are analyzed: (1) direct consequences, (2) reactions to failure, and (3) consequences of reaction to failure. Three examples of "negative" (not judgemental, but as in "decreasing something") reactions to failure on industry: second hand legitimacy, boomerang effect, poisoned-well.
