## One-paragraph summary

The threat of being perceived as a hypocrit reduces the probability that an organization publishes its certification status. For instance, when a corporation is mentioned in articles that discuss environmental protests, boycot, or lawsuits, the probability of publishing a well-recognized certification (DJSI) decreases. For claims that fall into a different domain than reputation threat itself, there is no such trend--corporate hypocrisy is only perceived when reputation threat and disclosed certification fall into the same area.
