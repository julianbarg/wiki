## Concepts
* Resilience: "Resilience is the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks." (Walker 2004: 6)
* Latitude: "the maximum amount the system can be changed before losing its ability to recover" (Walker 2004: 6)
* Resistance: "the ease or difficulty of changing the system" (Walker 2004: 6)
* Precariousness: "the current trajectory of the system, and how close it currently is to a limit or "threshold" which, if breached, makes recovery difficult or impossible (Walker 2004: 7)
* Panarchy: "how the above three attributes are influence by the states and dynamics of the (sub)systems at scales above and below the scale of interest" (Walker 2004: 7)
* Transformability: "the capacity to create untried beginnings from which to evolve a new way of living when existing ecological, economic or social structures become untenable." (Walker et al. 2004: 5)
* Adaptability: "In a SES, adaptability is the collective capacity of the human actors in the system to manage resilience" (Walker at al. 2004: 7)

## One-paragraph summary
Building on previous conceptualizations of social-ecological systems (SES) and adaptive cycles, Walker et al. (2004) lay out the attributes of a resilient system. Systems exhibit stability landscapes, with basins of attractions that represent alternative, stable states. These basins of attractions can have different latitudesâ€”"maximum amount a system can be changed before losing its ability to recover" (Walker et al. 2004: 2). Once they leave on basin of attraction, they may drift toward another basin. Human action takes an important role in this process, both intentionally and unintentionally. They can react to change the stability landscape, and accommodate the current state without the system drifting into another basin of attraction. Or they can conceptualize a new landscape, and sometimes take extensive action toward that purpose (e.g., an agricultural landscape that has become nonviable is repurposed into a landscape for ecotourism).
