## Basics

### Research Question

* What are do the processes of an institutional discourse play out?
    * (_Would it be appropriate to speak of microfoundations here?_)

### Phenomenon

* Keystone XL debate
    * Deinstitutionalization attempts of major pipeline projects
    * Deinstitutionalization attempts of the fossil fuel industry
    * Institutional defense
    * Forums

### Literatures

* Discourse and institutions
    * @Maguire2009
    * @Suddaby2017
    * @Latour1984
    * @Latour2005
* Deinstitutionalization
    * @Maguire2009
    * @Oliver1992
* Institutional defense
    * @Montgomery2020
    * @Maguire2009

### Research gap/contribution

A critical examination of the process of deinstitutionalization with a focus on the process, rather than working backward from the outcome, or analysing the actions of one side.

### Advantages of the empirical context

* Lengthy process with opportunities for repeat observation
* High stakes--symbolic importance of KXL beyond project
    * For future pipeline construction
    * For future large fossil fuel projects
    * (For polarized American political landscape)
* Involvement of diverse actors
    * Potential test robustness to actor attributes
* Repeated success and failure of the project
    * Arguably, no selection on outcome variable?
* (Environmental outcomes of the project)

### Methods

* Discourse analysis
* Sample on "forums"
* Qualitative methods
    * Narratives
    * Coding and higher-order constructs

### Findings

* Shortcomings of discourse
    * Not a process of information transfer
        * Because interests are at play
    * All actors wield strategies to derail process
    * Fragile process
        * Tendency to derail into subconflicts
        * Tendency to react to new rather than deeper information
    * Outcomes frequently not as intended by actors

### Open questions

* How to first introduce the empirical context
* References to the literature

I am responding both to @Maguire2009 and @Montgomery2020. To @Maguire2009 I pose the question--and answer it--what happens in-between? What does the process of deinstitutionalization really look like, if we do not take the result for granted. To @Montgomery2020 I respond with an analysis of two (or multiple) sides in a process. How aggressively do I frame this? The other question is, how do I handle the motivation--responding to two threads of literature--without appearing unfocused? Would a hypothetical introduction focus on only one?

### Models for structuring a hypothetical introduction

* Model 1
    * Phenomenon
    * What does it generalize to in terms of theory?
    * How does the phenomenon relate to the theory?
    * What is/are the research question(s) and/or puzzle?
    * How does answering them advance the theory or would be the implications for theory?
    * What are the findings of the study and what _are_ the implications for theory?
* Model 2
    * Phenomenon
    * What does the research say about this and what research gap does this imply?
    * Backgdrop of the phenomenon
    * Methods and findings
    * Summary
* Model 3
    * Summary in the language of theory with phenomenon as specific case.
    * Research gap
    * Methods
    * Implications

### Pivotal Quote

> Current public debate about oil-sands development focuses on individual pipeline decisions. Each is presented as an ultimatum â€” a binary choice between project approval and lost economic opportunity. This approach artificially restricts discussions to only a fraction of the consequences of oil development, such as short-term economic gains and job creation, and local impacts on human health and the environment. Lost is a broader conversation about national and international energy and economic strategies, and their trade-offs with environmental justice and conservation.
