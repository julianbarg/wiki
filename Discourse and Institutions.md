### Pivotal Quote

> Current public debate about oil-sands development focuses on individual pipeline decisions. Each is presented as an ultimatum â€” a binary choice between project approval and lost economic opportunity. This approach artificially restricts discussions to only a fraction of the consequences of oil development, such as short-term economic gains and job creation, and local impacts on human health and the environment. Lost is a broader conversation about national and international energy and economic strategies, and their trade-offs with environmental justice and conservation.
