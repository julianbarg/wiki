## Basics

### Research Question

* What are the microfoundations of an institutional discourse?

### Phenomenon

* Keystone XL debate
    * Deinstitutionalization attempts of major pipeline projects
    * Deinstitutionalization attempts of the fossil fuel industry
    * Institutional defense
    * Forums

### Literatures

* Discourse and institutions

    * @Suddaby2017
    * @Latour1984
    * @Latour2005
* Deinstitutionalization
    * @Maguire2009
    * @Oliver1992
* Institutional defense

### Research gap/contribution

A critical examination of the process of deinstitutionalization with a focus on the process, rather than working backward from the outcome.

### Advantages of the empirical context

* Lengthy process with opportunities for repeat observation
* High stakes--symbolic importance of KXL beyond project
    * For future pipeline construction
    * For future large fossil fuel projects
    * (For polarized AmericaN political landscape)
* Involvement of diverse actors
    * Potential test robustness to actor attributes
* Repeated success and failure of the project
    * Arguably, no selection on outcome variable?
* (Environmental outcomes of the project)

### Methods

* Discourse analysis
* Sample on "forums"
* Coding and higher-order constructs

### Pivotal Quote

> Current public debate about oil-sands development focuses on individual pipeline decisions. Each is presented as an ultimatum â€” a binary choice between project approval and lost economic opportunity. This approach artificially restricts discussions to only a fraction of the consequences of oil development, such as short-term economic gains and job creation, and local impacts on human health and the environment. Lost is a broader conversation about national and international energy and economic strategies, and their trade-offs with environmental justice and conservation.
