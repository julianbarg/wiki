## Important points
* **Learning definition**: Like [[Levitt and March 1988]], not defined by improvements, but by change.

## One-paragraph summary

Literature started with the notion that strategy is emergent (from rules and routines). RBC and [[Dynamic Capabilities]] introduced the notion that organizations have the ability to optimize these tacit processes. Learning was conceived to explain the tacit processes further. Cognitive tradition in learning also plays in this direction. The central issues remain:

* **(1)**: Industry structure - does it create convergence, or could it foster divergent substructures?
* **(2)**: What factors shape industry evolution and learning?
* **(3)**: Industry robustness - where does that originate?

## One-page summary

After defining the three questions (see above), Miner and Anderson (1999) discuss changes in two different areas. With regards to the mechanisms, they set up their assumptions:

* Learning as a (qualitative) change in knowledge and/or behavior, rather than performance improvements.
* Learning co-occurs on different levels, i.e., individual and collective.
* Scope of learning at a collective level is not the aggregate of individual-level learning below.
