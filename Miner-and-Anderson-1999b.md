## One-paragraph summary

Literature started with the notion that strategy is emergent (from rules and routines). RBC and [[Dynamic Capabilities]] introduced the notion that organizations have the ability to optimize these tacit processes. Learning was conceived to explain the tacit processes further. Cognitive tradition in learning also plays in this direction. The central issues remain:

* **(1)**: Industry structure - does it create convergence, or could it foster divergent substructures?
* **(2)**: What factors shape industry evolution and learning?
* **(3)**: Industry robustness - where does that originate?
