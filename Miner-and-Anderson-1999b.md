* **Learning definition**: Like [[Levitt and March 1988]], not defined by improvements, but by change.

## One-paragraph summary

Literature started with the notion that strategy is emergent (from rules and routines). RBC and [[Dynamic Capabilities]] introduced the notion that organizations have the ability to optimize these tacit processes. Learning was conceived to explain the tacit processes further. Cognitive tradition in learning also plays in this direction. The central issues remain:

* **(1)**: Industry structure - does it create convergence, or could it foster divergent substructures?
* **(2)**: What factors shape industry evolution and learning?
* **(3)**: Industry robustness - where does that originate?

## One-page summary

After defining the three questions (see above), Miner and Anderson (1999) discuss changes in two different areas. With regards to the mechanisms, they set up their assumptions:

* Learning as a (qualitative) change in knowledge and/or behavior, rather than performance improvements.
* Learning co-occurs on different levels, i.e., individual and collective.
* Scope of learning at a collective level is not the aggregate of individual-level learning below.
* Interaction of learning to study strategy.
* Population-level learning goes beyond change in frequency of certain type of organizations, instead, it entails qualitative change in a larger group of organizations.

There are three observed types of population-level learning:

* Parallel independent organizational learning.
* Recurrent organizational learning. Organizations learn from each other, or cooperate on projects, observations are drawn from multiple, repeated observations.
* Collective population learning. "[A]t least one learning step is collective" (ibid., 8), e.g., SEMATECH. Does that mean, a scientific breakthrough is collective population learning? "[T]he degree to which learning processes are collective represents a continuous rather than discrete variable" (ibid., 8).

In summary:

**"The framework [...] opens the door for conceptions of industry development that do not take the firm itself as the most crucial unit of analysis"** (ibid., 25). Also, criticism of neoinstitutional theory: why aren't all firms exactly the same (ibid., 25f).
