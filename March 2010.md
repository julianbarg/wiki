### Chapter 1: The Persuit of Intelligence

Two different types of intelligence: adaptive intelligence and interpretative intelligence. Primary challenge is not individual bias but "in the nature of experience" (p. 13, see also title of book).

### Chapter 2: Learning through Replicating Success

Two types of learning: high-intellect and low-intellect. Three types

### Chapter 3: Learning through Stories and Models

Organizations are masterful storytellers. Which also implies that we should not buy into narratives of observations that feed into learning. Also implying that the study of creating narratives is relevant? Compare [[Rowlinson, Hassard & Decker 2014]]. Four mythic themes in organizations: rationality, hierarchy, individual leader significance, and historical efficiency. 

## Important points

* "At least at first blush, it appears that novelty survives not because it offers selective advantage within specifiable adaptive mechanisms but because those mechanisms are actually quite inefficient instuments of improvement and thusinefficient in eliminating the instruments of novelty" (p. 84). 

## Reactions
* (Reg. bandit problems, p. 19) maybe, as a society, we have not sampled enough different technologies.
* Chapter 3: obvious parallels to criticism of "heroid figures" ([[Rowlinson, Hassard & Decker 2014]])
