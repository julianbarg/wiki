## Writing for Truth, Beauty & Justice

Writing for truth, beauty and justice both presents some challenges to be overcome. We acknowledge that the "filling a gap" approach to research is probably the easiest, with a great risk/reward ratio--although hopefully most of our peers are not thinking in this fashion. Writing with truth, beauty and justice in mind--especially all three of them--is trickier. Creating models with justice in mind almost always includes exposing some of our values and stating that we think an issue is important. If it is "established" that this issue is not suitable for publishing in our field, there are often significant challenges to be overcome for our work to get published. Frontrunners for issues such as gender inequality, racial discrimination, or the global exploitation of people and our planet can probably tell you a thing or two about that. And as Pfeffer (2010, 2015) observed, it is far from guaranteed that these efforts will be rewarded. @Whiteman2016 for instance took over a decade for their piece--their most significant observation from the fieldwork!--to get published. The rewards for them are meager, in instrumental (career-oriented) terms. 

Building beauty into models can be much easier. New ways of quantitative modelling, visualizations of qualitative and quantitative work, and new, elegant theoretical models are all common ways of how we build beauty into our work. The challenge arises when we turn to the intersection of beauty and truth or justice. Building a simple, elegant model might not be easy, but it is certainly satisfying. Doing away with that one step of step of convenient simplification or an omission, and covering some extra cases--such as those of marginalized communities--can yield a model that is more true to the fact, at the expense of beauty. When attending to social justice, it has to be noted that the world is not always beautiful. Working with marginalized communities often surfaces aspects of our world that challenge our established, "convenient" models of how the world operates, e.g., the notion of a fair and independent justice system.

Truth, when taken to the extreme, may be the most difficult of the bunch. At the exteeme end, truth involves dealing with "established facts" in our field. Those assumptions that are taken for granted, set in stone by those who have been in the business for much longer than us. It is more convenient to turn toward a gap in research, where we do not have to struggle against the headwind of conventions. Where our discoveries are also true, but leave us with the sense that there are much bigger fishes that we have left on the table. That is especially true when we seek out the convenient gap at the expense of a tough nut that does also touch on an injustice we have observed in the world, or an area of our world where we have a more just version of our world in mind. When that is the case, beauty might just be the factor that may allow us to get there. In that sense, the three transcendentals can come together beautifully at times: when an author uses an attractive new method to show us the potential for a better, more just world, and by doing so delivers a model that contradicts some stubborn "established facts" in its field.
