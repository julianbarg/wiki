## One-paragraph summary

Walsh and Ungson (1991) develop a more coherent model of organizational memory. They note that a challenge in theory development is the error of commission (and omission). The description of organization having a "memory" may invoke a homomorphic interpretation. When metaphor is understood as a literal description, more attributes are expected to be present than there actually are in the target. In reality, while the function of the organizational memory may be somewhat similar to that in humans, it takes a very different shape.

The organizational memory includes five different bins: (1) individuals, (2) culture, (3) transformations (e.g., of socialization, budgeting, or market planning) , (4) structures (describing structures between members, e.g., between professors and students), and (5) ecology (e.g., physical structure). Some memories may also be stored in external archives, such as news media.

What is missing from the article is the fact that memory can be disfunctional (or maybe the authors do not normatively judge on the content of the memory in the first place).
