## [[Learning]], [[Institutional Theory]], and [[Logics]]

* What is the difference between [[Learning]], [[Institutional Theory]], and [[Logics]]?
* Obviously there is a difference between the three, but they have a commonality in that they try to explain the diffusion of routines/practices/technology.
* Is there a point in comparing them?
* What are routines by the way? Should I know that?
* Certainly, the other two are superior to Institutional Theory, because at least they take into consideration that there can be a reason for something which individuals can comprehend, even if the reason may be flawed.
* On the other hand, may aspiration levels suggests that there is not a reason for something, but imply social orientation?
