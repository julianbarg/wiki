## [[Learning]], [[Institutional Theory]], and [[Logics]]

* What is the difference between [[Learning]], [[Institutional Theory]], and [[Logics]]?
* Obviously there is a difference between the three, but they have a commonality in that they try to explain the diffusion of routines/practices/technology.
* Is there a point in comparing them?
* What are routines by the way? Should I know that?
