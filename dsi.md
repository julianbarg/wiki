# Decoupling--Impression Management--Symbolic Management

# 2021

## November

### 2021-11-23 11:28 Make the title something with recoupling and/or agency?

 
### 2021-11-24 12:01 Malicious decoupling

 
### 2021-11-24 13:57 Limitation of decoupling.

Decoupling is almost exclusively internal and does not consider the interaction between an organization and its environment.
 
### 2021-11-25 18:52 Limitation of SI.

Symbolic management is about manipulating authorities such as regulators or shareholders into beliefing that you meet whatever specific expectation they might have of you, and also sometimes touches on anticipation and preventative action. My stuff is going one step further by looking how firms specifically shape the environment and attempt--succeed--to infuence public discourse.
 
### 2021-11-25 19:20 Division of powers.

It also strices me that the literature seems to assume as default well developed market economies with a clear separation of societal spheres--business, politics, civil society, legal system. Whereas the default in the world might be some degree of state capitalism. We have also seen in the US some backsliding into more control over the state by oligarchs from the economic sector.
 
### 2021-11-25 19:41 Westphal limitation.

@Westphal2020 does not seem to look beyond stakeholders to the external environment at large.
 
### 2021-11-25 20:02 Naivity in symbolic management.

In the last section on solutions--is that even an appropriate category when talking about problems in group psychology?--@Westphal2020 seems quite naive, looking for paternalistic issues that stem from more education.
 
### 2021-11-25 20:30 Durand--Oliver.

@Durand2019 opens with @Oliver1991 in the first article, but then only focuses on a subset of the behaviors listed by her.
 
### 2021-11-25 20:34 Durand--Oliver 2.

Or maybe--to pick up my research groups comment--maybe I am the one misinterpreting @Oliver1991, and @Durand2019 has it right. Maybe manipulation is malignant decoupling. On the other hand I always took @Oliver1991 to execute a reaching through from the organization to the environment, letting us imagine some real two-way interaction.
 
### 2021-11-26 13:18 The role of beliefs--identity.

The key part is that climate/fossil misinformation works by being congruent with what a lot of people already belief--maybe with what had been fostered before. The actors are much deeper in discourse than what dsi sees.
 
### 2021-11-26 13:34 Limitation of misconduct literature.

The way that @Durand2019a presents the misconduct literature following @Oliver1991, it is really not what we are looking for at all, not far-sighted enough. Too focused on consequences of misbehavior.
 
### 2021-11-27 09:33 Symbolic management of spills.

A spill is generally seen as substantive, not symbolic, but symbolic management comes into play almost immediately. When we try to comprehend the spill, the culprits will generally come out and emphasize how low emission levels are [@Kim2007a]. High or low are not substantive categories, they both fall into the realm of symbolic management--there cannot be such thing as high or low without social construction, though the spill can--with some edge cases--just be a spill.
 
### 2021-11-27 09:42 State capitalism.

Maybe @Schnackenberg2019 even still underestimates to what degree firms can be involved--intervowen--with culture. Or maybe the fossil-conservative axis is just an extreme case? In more authoritative states, it would not be seen as an extreme case though? In the west it is? I am sure I can come up with other examples though? East India Company? Nokia? Amazon & Ireland on tax? Trump industries--albeit briefly? Plantation culture and the Confederation?
 
### 2021-11-27 10:05 Symbolic management is closely related to frames/framing.

See for example @Lindenberg2011 [via. @Schnackenberg2019 p. 382].
 
### 2021-11-27 13:44 Cynicism.

So far, as of page 399 of @Schnackenberg2019, a sense of cynicism seems to be absent from the literature. Symbolic management appears as a serious exercise, rather than as the social play with words and signs/symbols that it is.

2021-11-27 14:10] Normalization of the cynical.
Seems that after normalizing the cynical--developing the literature from @Elsbach1994 to @Schnackenberg2019--there is space for us to move in the other direction. To see the cynical in the world where managing with symbols is normalized.
 
### 2021-11-27 19:01 The convenience of symbols and decoupling?

The more recent literature is quite direct in suggesting that symbols are simply easier to manage than substance, that that is more effective. The older literature on the other hand presents symbolic management as a fact of life.
 
### 2021-11-28 16:59 Qual methods.

@Cole2019 methods section is something I should take a look at again in the future.
 
### 2021-11-28 21:39 Bansal.

Why did people enjoy that @Bansal2004? Was it a cynical love? Did people love that it showed the potential for impression management?
 
### 2021-11-29 10:53 Uncertainty.

Ironically, science cannot deal with real uncertainty, because it makes for measures we cannot operationalize.
