## One-paragraph summary
Organizational ecology builds on studies of ecology in biology. The environment is the most important player in the game. Other streams of literature focus on how firms adopt to changing environments, but organizational inertia is strong, and it is more likely that firms disappear when the environment changes in unfavorable ways. What matters is what niches firms manage to occupy, and how well they fit. What organizations can survive based on the resources that are available?
