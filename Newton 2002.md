# @Newton 2002

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]], [[Constructivism & Ecology]]_

* At the time visiting professor at UBC

## One-paragraph summary

Newton concludes that an "eco-ordering" project is unlikely to succeed. Grown networks are required for pursuing a green agenda. Similarly, the existing order rests on grown networks that would be difficult, if not impossible, to disassemble. "[A]s the example of the automobile industry suggests, we also need to examine the network convergence that currently supports environmentally degrading industrial processes if we are to understand the challenges of greening them" (@Newton2002, p. 534). Overall, Newton advocates for more attention to networks in sustainability--and explicitely mentions organizational learning as an example.
