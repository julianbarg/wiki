## One-page summary
March (1991) picks up the tradition of weighting exploration against exploitation and relates the discussion to learning. March emphasizes the risk of exploitation.

* *Exploration*: "Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation" (ibid., 71)

* *Exploitation*: "Exploitation includes such things as refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution." (ibid., 71)

**->** "Adaptive systems that engage in exploration to the exclusion of exploitation are likely to find that they suffer the costs of experimentation without gaining many of its benefits. They exhibit too many undeveloped new ideas and too little distinctive competence." (ibid. 71)

Rather than discussion the perfect balance between exploration and exploitation (his preliminary answer boils down to "somewhere in the middle"), March discusses the trade-offs between the two under different circumstances, and relates the discussion to the behavioral theory of the firm. In a classic rational choice model, choices are made between present and future, certain and uncertain bets, and outcomes are affected by previous as well as other actors' choices.

March introduces limited rationality to the equation. Following [[Cyert and March 1963]], organizations exhibit aspiration levels, and actual performance thus stimulates (or inhibits) search (exploration). The organizational learning literature on the other hand, emphasizes that spending resources on refinement of existing technology means that these resources cannot be invested in invention of new ones. Further, as an organization improves its competence in a procedure, experimentation with other procedures becomes less attractive (because the existing procedure is already so refined and effective). (+ evolutionary model).

Finally, March arrives at the "second derivative" of exploration/exploitation. As organizations engage in exploration or exploitation, they receive feedback on their actions: whether their bats pay off or not affects future choices between exploration and exploitation. An organization that developed a successful new technology will be inclined to explore in the future. The performance of these previous bets however is not correlated with what behavior will pay off in the future (e.g., an oil company that has fared well with not exploring new technologies from 1960-2010 cannot be sure to further perform well in the future just based on exploitation). The signals that organizations receive regarding the success of exploration are much more delayed and ambiguous. "It is quite possible for competence in an inferior activity to become great enough to exclude superior activities with which an organization has little experience. Since long-run intelligence depends on sustaining a reasonable level of exploration, these tendencies to increase exploitation and reduce exploration make adaptive processes potentially self-destructive" (ibid. 73).

Organizations may want to control their tendency to steer toward exploitation. This is explored in the empirical section of the paper. The first simulation shows that too strong socialization leads to a long-run equilibrium of organizational knowledge that is quite "low" (diverges a lot from the real state of the world). The second simulation shows that heterogeneity in individuals' learning rates can benefit an organization. Slow learners (from the code) allow the organization to arrive at a higher equilibrium knowledge stock, whereas most of the learning within the organization is achieved (quickly) by the fast learners (Figure 3).

The more important third simulation shows the relevance of turnover for knowledge, and strike a
