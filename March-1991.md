## One-paragraph summary
March (1991) picks up the tradition of weighting exploration against exploitation and relates the discussion to learning. March emphasizes the risk of exploitation.

* *Exploration*: "Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation" (ibid., 71)

* *Exploitation*: "Exploitation includes such things as refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution." (ibid., 71)

-----

*->* "Adaptive systems that engage in exploration to the exclusion of exploitation are likely to find that they suffer the costs of experimentation without gaining many of its benefits. They exhibit too many undeveloped new ideas and too little distinctive competence." (ibid. 71)
