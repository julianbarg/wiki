## One-page summary
March (1991) picks up the tradition of weighting exploration against exploitation and relates the discussion to learning. March emphasizes the risk of exploitation.

* *Exploration*: "Exploration includes things captured by terms such as search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, innovation" (ibid., 71)

* *Exploitation*: "Exploitation includes such things as refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, execution." (ibid., 71)

**->** "Adaptive systems that engage in exploration to the exclusion of exploitation are likely to find that they suffer the costs of experimentation without gaining many of its benefits. They exhibit too many undeveloped new ideas and too little distinctive competence." (ibid. 71)

Rather than discussion the perfect balance between exploration and exploitation (his preliminary answer boils down to "somewhere in the middle"), March discusses the trade-offs between the two under different circumstances, and relates the discussion to the behavioral theory of the firm. In a classic rational choice model, choices are made between present and future, certain and uncertain bets, and outcomes are affected by previous as well as other actors' choices.

March introduces limited rationality to the equation. Following [[Cyert and March 1963]], organizations exhibit aspiration levels, and actual performance thus stimulates (or inhibits) search (exploration). The organizational learning literature on the other hand, emphasizes that spending resources on refinement of existing technology means that these resources cannot be invested in invention of new ones. Further, as an organization improves its competence in a procedure, experimentation with other procedures becomes less attractive (because the existing procedure is already so refined and effective).
