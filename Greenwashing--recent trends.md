Article         | Synopsis
---             | ---------------
@Nemes2021      | Greenwashing can be intentional or unintentional, and can be commited by many organizations, not only corporations. It ranges from exaggeration to fabrication. 
@deFreitasNetto2020 | Greenwashing can take place at the organizational or product level, through specific, misleading claims or through implications. 
@Szabo2020      | B corporations deliberately use images, videos and social media. Users respond to greenwashing negatively, but providing more information reduces greenwashing perception--irrespective of truthfulness!
@Torelli2020    | Impact on observer perception of greenwashing depends on the level that occurs at: corporate, strategic, dark or product level. 
@Fabrizio2019   | Linguistic analysis of obfuscation--readability or Fog index. Corporations use more obfuscation when communicating negative information.
@Gatti2019      | Greenwashing poses a problem for the rise of CSR. (Publicized) voluntary efforts should be considered as legal responsibilities.
@Carlos2018     | When reports mention e.g., protests or boycot threats a firm is less likely to disclose a positive environmental signal--DJSI certification.
@Testa2018      | (In)coherence between environmental action & communication--greenwashers do not benefit, but brownwashers are punished in financial performance.
@Seele2017      | The important step in greenwashing is the accusation--toward a discursive (my words) constitution of greenwash. Article stays shallow though.
@Siano2017      | The Volkswagen emissions scandal represents a new quality of greenwashing--deliberate manipulation through a physical artifact and software.
@Crilly2016     | Implementors use more precise exclusive language ("versus", "but", "only"), decouplers make grand claims using inclusive language ("and", "all", "also").
@Hawn2016       | Firms should strike the balance between interally and externally oriented CSR actions--a bit more outside communication helps financial performance.
@Marquis2016    | Measuring selective disclosure as how much information is disclosed vs. how relevant it is. Under public scrutiny, firms disclosre less selectively.
@Kim2015        | Firms consider their disclosure level independent from their environmental activities. Firms might *brownwash* to cater to investors.
@Lyon2015       | Taxonomy--difference between e.g., conceptualizations decoupling, symbolic management, and economic models of greenwashing etc. Calling for more systematic categorizing.
