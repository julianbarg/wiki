Article         | Synopsis
---             | ---------------
@Fabrizio2019   | Linguistic analysis of obfuscation--readability or Fog index. Corporations use more obfuscation when communicating negative information.
@Carlos2018     | When reports mention e.g., protests or boycot threats a firm is less likely to disclose a positive environmental signal--DJSI certification.
@Testa2018      | Discrepancies between environmental action & communication--greenwashers do not benefit, but brownwashers are punished in financial performance.
@Lyon2015       | Taxonomy. Clarifying difference between conceptualizations such as decoupling, symbolic management, and economic models of greenwashing.
