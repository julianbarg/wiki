* P. 112: "It is a question of what *governs* statements, and the way in which they *govern* each other so as to constitute a set of propositions which are scientifically acceptable , and hence capable of being verified
or falsified by scientific procedures. In short, there is a problem of the regime, the politics of the scientific statement."

* P. 117: "I wanted to see how these problems of constitution could be resolved within a historical framework, instead of referring them back to a constituent object (madness, criminality or whatever) . But this historical contextualisation needed to be something more than the simple relativisation of the phenomenological subject. I don't believe the problem can be solved by historicising the subject as posited by the phenomenologists, fabricating a subject that evolves through the course of history. One has to dispense with the con? stituent subject , to get rid of the subject itself, that's to say, to arrive at an analysis which can account for the constitu? tion of the subject within a historical framework. And this is what I would call genealogy, that is, a form of history which can account for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects etc. , without having to make reference to a subject which is either transcendental in relation to the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course of history." - **A coevolution/"coprogression" of history and ideas.
