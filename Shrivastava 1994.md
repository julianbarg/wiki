# @Shrivastava1994

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

* Paul Shrivastava was born in Bhopal, India. He wrote more orthodox pieces up until after the Bhopal disaster

## One-sentence summary

@Shrivastava1994 advocates for a move away from a castrated organizational environment, where castrated is a mnemonic for **C**ompetition, **A**bstraction, **S**hallowness, **T**heoretical Immaturity, **R**eductionism, **A**nthropocentrism, **T**ime Independent (Ahistorical), **E**xploitable, and **D**enaturalized. He introduces both the roots of the anthropocentric view in organizational theory and the roots of ecology in the environmental discourse, including _Naturalism and Ecology_, _Reform Environmentalism_, _Radical Environmentalism_, and _Eco-Feminism_. Finally, he advocates for a greening of organizational studies, which again stands for **G**ood **R**eturns, **E**conomics of **E**thics, **N**ature's **I**ndependence, and **N**ature's **G**oodness. He describes his conceptualization of the environment as the eco-biosphere.
