## Session 1

* [[Pratt 2000]]
* [[Rosen 1991]]

### Notes

Drift rather than design--starting out with an idea to explore. But what you might think is important, it might not be important to the community you study. 

- Ethnography, Grounded Theory, or Case Study.

- Clustering (where stuff is the same) vs variance seeking.

- How do you design your study so you can be proven wrong?

- Sampling strategies--purposeful & theoretical: "Extreme", Prototypical, where your dynamics of interest are observable. Sample size: when is saturation achieved? Are my categories saturated--I might not be learning more because I am not asking the right questions?

- Generalizable (consider naturalistic--if I know about an oak tree, I might know about another kind of tree), Specificity, Replicability

- Basic iterative steps: find out what informants say, then find out what the literature says and begin to build your own theory. Finally, tell a story.

- Writing is important: show confidencen and integrity. Provisional self? Developing your voice. Needs to have gap and hook.

### Ethnography

Participant observation & interviews. Types of ethnographies: classic ethnography, video ethnography, netnography. Research questions should be qualitative friendly. Access: connections ("gatekeepers", "idea champions", "key informants"), buy-in from people who can give you access, thinking why they might want to give you access, persistence, "credentials", tentative investment (pilot study). Anonymize: use a coding scheme, ask interview partners not to use real names, come up with, e.g., jump forward 3 letters in the alphabet.

## Session 2

* [[Pratt & Bonaccio 2016]]
* [[Pratt 2015]]

Observation--there is overt and covert--covert is difficult to do, work is going to be overt. Participant or non-participant. What do I record? (1) Record everything. (2) Look for nothing in particular--take notes when something disruptive happens. (3) Look for paradoxes. (4) Identify key problems. Other techniques--(1) mapping--sketching out the scene, (2) interactions--who talks to whom, or non-verbal communication. 

- Putting inferences in brackets. What about the environment? What about a particular groups? Those are choices you can make.
