# Sessions

## Session 1

* [[Pratt 2000]]
* [[Rosen 1991]]

### Notes

Drift rather than design--starting out with an idea to explore. But what you might think is important, it might not be important to the community you study. 

- Ethnography, Grounded Theory, or Case Study.

- Clustering (where stuff is the same) vs variance seeking.

- How do you design your study so you can be proven wrong?

- Sampling strategies--purposeful & theoretical: "Extreme", Prototypical, where your dynamics of interest are observable. Sample size: when is saturation achieved? Are my categories saturated--I might not be learning more because I am not asking the right questions?

- Generalizable (consider naturalistic--if I know about an oak tree, I might know about another kind of tree), Specificity, Replicability

- Basic iterative steps: find out what informants say, then find out what the literature says and begin to build your own theory. Finally, tell a story.

- Writing is important: show confidencen and integrity. Provisional self? Developing your voice. Needs to have gap and hook.

### Ethnography

Participant observation & interviews. Types of ethnographies: classic ethnography, video ethnography, netnography. Research questions should be qualitative friendly. Access: connections ("gatekeepers", "idea champions", "key informants"), buy-in from people who can give you access, thinking why they might want to give you access, persistence, "credentials", tentative investment (pilot study). Anonymize: use a coding scheme, ask interview partners not to use real names, come up with, e.g., jump forward 3 letters in the alphabet.

## Session 2

* [[Pratt & Bonaccio 2016]]
* [[Pratt 2015]]

Observation--there is overt and covert--covert is difficult to do, work is going to be overt. Participant or non-participant. What do I record? (1) Record everything. (2) Look for nothing in particular--take notes when something disruptive happens. (3) Look for paradoxes. (4) Identify key problems. Other techniques--(1) mapping--sketching out the scene, (2) interactions--who talks to whom, or non-verbal communication. 

- Putting inferences in brackets. What about the environment? What about a particular groups? Those are choices you can make.

- Taking notes: start with stream of consciousness, then reflect. Is it too interpretative? Similar for interviews: look at it, did I talk too much.

- Mike--doesn't start taking notes until 5-10 minutes in. Doesn't even start with a research question, just has a topic in mind. And starts unstructured. Maybe then you will find something that you are interested in. Drop by regularly so they do not forget who I am. Sometimes you observe, sometimes you can poke the organization and see how they react.

- Making observations is a way to come up with research questions. Question previous notions.

- Participant observation types: (1) Job type--shouldn't be too impactful, (2) commitment acts--decide as much how far you are willing to go, (3) participating and observing?!--not quite possible, (4) identity investment.

- Conflicts--sometimes embrace if central, if not central, avoid.

- Time capsule--put in some information about yourself, like favorite things. How do your political leanings change, e.g., in terms of liking politicians?

**Ethnographic interviewing**

multiple interviews, going from general to specific, analyze inbetween, change interview protocol over time (e.g., not working, already answered by sufficient people).

Ethnographic explanations--native language explanations--encourage informants to talk to you in their own cultural slang. Also "I am not looking for anything in specific, you are the expert, I want to hear what you think".

Types of questions: (1) grand tour questions, e.g., take me through a typical day, (2) specific, e.g., what did you do on time or task, (3) guided, e.g., show me around the office, (4) task-related, e.g., how do you admit a patient?--draw it out (5) example--including "dumb" questions, (6) hypothetical interaction, (7) structural question, e.g., how is x categorized, what are your categories of work? (8) cover questions--are there other types of... (9) verification question, (10) card questions--give them somethign to visualize (11) contract questions.

Complementing informants--you did a great job mapping out the field, how to you categorize yourself.

Work--location-dependent memory. So--in the workplace, private conference room if possible. Set up the room, e.g., remove all chairs except two that are set together. Recordings: maybe set up two recordings, something always goes wrong with one of them. Keep recording--people say interesting stuff after the informant is gone. Maximum of 4 interviews per day, leave 30 minutes, because maybe you want to take some notes inbetween. "We have ten minutes left, is it ok if we go longer"--if no, skik to most important question.

## Session 3

* [[Spradley 1979]]
* [[Van Maanen 1979]]

Asking questions--silence is valuable--people will fill it.

Still take notes even when audio recording--non-verbals--e.g., questions make people uncomfortable, or what follow-up questions I want to ask.

Avoid leading questions and making assumptions.

Power quotes vs proof quotes. Putting proof quotes into appendix.

More from terms and meanings to buckets, and then discover the relationship between the buckets.

Card technique--grab some illustrative card, ask personal question--"which one reminds me of your childhood?". Will get people talking. As visual prompt.

What goes in your field notes--e.g., take condensed notes in the field, try to complete within 24 hours. E.g., notes on a napkin, that evoke memories. Organize it though--what do I need to organize, what do I not need but still keep.

Field journal--field notes are your data, in the field journal you do memoing. You take notes on the theories you want to build. Writing down the connections you see.

## Session 4

* [[Pratt 2008]]

- You should have a lot of codes. Resist creating too abstract codes right away. Try to be verbatim. Try to code every part of the interview.
- You go into the interviews with a framework, but the framework should be fragile.
- Downside with coding: how to go from second order codes to theory?
- Spradley - domain analysis/taxonomic analysis/componential analysis
- Member checks--figure out if there is something you got wrong factually

Meta-theory of coding: (1) Find out what informants say (first-order code, provisional codes). (2) Find out what the literature says (enfold theory, 2nd order codes, axial coding). (3) Tell a story (aggregate dimensions).

Usually, papers have too much telling, and not enough showing.

Inductive research: needs to be grounded in theory, e.g., decide to do extreme samplesp. Deductive: can be random sample
