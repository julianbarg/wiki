[[Haack, Martignoni & Schoenenborn 2021]] | We could bring firms into compliance by luring them with easy standards and then upping transparency.
[[de Bree & Stroopendaal 2020]] | Decoupling can happen at different steps of planning and implementation, requiring distinct remedies.
[[Hengst et al 2020]]           | Employees go through multiple action cycles before eventually integrating sustainability and mainstream strategies.
[[Jacqueminet 2020]]            | Implementation depends on pressure from higher-ups and peers, and consistency with values.
[[Jacqueminet & Durand 2019]]   | Subunits decouple if they feel that a practice is not strategically important or incompatible with their values.
