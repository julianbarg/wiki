## One-paragraph summary
The case study of a hybrid organization: a food cooperative with a pragmatist and an idealist wing. The two sides of the organization materialize in two "wings" of different groups of individuals that come to embody the two identities. The two groups act as "checks and balances" for each other and allow the organization to pursue diverging goals (usually at separate points of time). Also, because of the presence of the other group, members did not need to address the duality or paradox of the diverging goals themselves; instead, they could continue to embody the side of the coin they saw themselves on ("it is often easier [...] to fight with others than with oneself"].
