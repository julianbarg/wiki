## One-page summary

Organizational behavior (at the time) was often seen in terms of the complete cycle of organizational choice. March and Olsen (1975) raise multiple concerns with this model. (1) Individuals' attitudes do not always inform behavior. Organizations in particular are able to disrupt the relationship between attitudes and behavior, e.g., through standard operating procedures.

## Important points
* The article is written in an era where there is a transition of the literature from rationality to limited rationality. March and Olsen want to bring this transition to organizations, through making simple observations, for instance the observation that organizations cannot always distinguish success from failure. 
* Distinguishing between rational calculation and learning from experience.
* Learning from experience also includes deliberate efforts--experimentation!
* Moving to individual belifes--beliefs, attitudes, concerns do not always affect action--because time and energy are scarce resources. This leads to trade-offs between different available choice situations--individuals who attend to one cannot attend to another, and thus individuals are selctive about which one they attend to. In an organzation, the relationship gets even more complex, as roles, duties, and standard operating procedures further alter individual behavior.
