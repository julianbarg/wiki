## One-page summary
Eisenhardt and Zbaracki (1992) evaluate the strategic decision making literature to date, specifically, the section that does not follow the assumption of perfect rationality. Specifically, they analyze the literature on bounded rationality, politics and power, and the garbage can model.

Eisenhard and Zbaracki (1992) find that bounded rationality (rather than rational actors) is already the accepted paradigm among management scholars. There are cognitive limits to rationality, and decision making processes are impacted by various factors that are not related to decision outcomes. Most importantly, as stated in the original work by Cyert and March (1963) "goals can be inconsistent across people and time" (ibid., 18).

With regard to politics and power, Eisenhard and Zbaracki (1992) present various studies that show how internal "architecture" of the organization impact decision making. A central question is again that of *goals*. The literature again does away with the assumption of a single, unifying goal that is pursued in a Hobbesian, value-maximizing fashion. Instead, decisions are made in a "political" fashion, and outcomes are determined by power. The literature is however in disagreement about the nature of coalitions. Are they stable, and determine goals among each other before implementing decision? Or are they fluid, and form in pursuit of goals? The strongest evidence for a political view of firms is the observation of politics in reality (e.g., qualitative studies). Also the notion that goals conflict between employees or departments (e.g., marketing vs. operations) cannot be dismissed.

Eisenhardt and Zbaracki (1992) thus suggest a research agenda that emphasized cognition, normative implications (why?), and conflict.

## Key takeaways
* "It is clear that people are rational, but only boundedly so, that power wins battles of choice, and that chance affects the course of strategic decision making" (ibid., 18).
* "[...] tired debates about single goals and perfect rationality [...]" (ibid. 18).
* "The recent incarnation transformed the rational vs. boundedly rational dichotomy into a continuum, probing whether and when decision making is rational" (ibid., 18).
* "Empirical research clearly supports (1) the existence of cognitive limits to the rational model. Decision makers satisfice instead of optimize, rarely engage in comprehensive search, and discover their goals in the process of searching" (ibid., 22).
