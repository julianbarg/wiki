## One-paragraph summary
Gersick explores the phenomenon of pacing using the case of a startup. She uncovers that the decision makers use two times of pacing for their decision making: *temporal pacing* (clock-time) and *event-based pacing* (event-time). The temporal pacing gets triggered by periodic events - the annual review that takes place six month before year-end. Event-based pacing is based on important milestones - FDA-approval and the profitability of the venture. While temporal pacing can ensure that crucial changes are made on time (before it is "too late" and targets are not met), event-based pacing can ensure that important targets are met, and are not lost sight of. Whereas time-based pacing can be counterproductive when a substantive goal is sabotaged because the time limit is inappropriate, event-based pacing carries the risk that an unobtainable goal is pursued indefinitely, an obviously unproductive pursuit.
