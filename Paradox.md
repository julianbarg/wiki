## One-paragraph summary
Paradox is an unconventional theory, insofar as it does not specify a specific level of analysis, but rather can by applied to different levels. Hence, Lewis and Smith (2014) call it a metatheory. A paradox is defined as "*persistent contradictions between interdependent elements*" (Schad et al. 2016: 10). A true paradox is present when the emphasis of one element only makes the other more prominent or powerful (rather than driving the other element out); true to the image of yin and yang in motion where one part might displace, but never eliminate, the other. The literature is disagree about the nature of paradoxes (Schad et al. 2016: 24). Scholarship holds that "paradoxical tensions stem from polarized cognitive or social constructions" (Lewis 2000: 761). In an organization (when it is viewed as system), tensions can exist between the goals of subsystems. When these tensions become salient, they sometimes become accentuated by actors (which do not understand all underlying dynamics) and appear to them as a paradox; hence, Lewis and Smith (2014) describes "organizational tensions as inherent in complex, dynamic, and ambiguous systems, and paradox as constructed through actors' responses" (Lewis and Smith 2014: 8).

Paradox has been applied to many different contexts, with the most prominent example (currently) being hybrid organizations. Ashforth and Reinigen (2014) explore the case of a food cooperative. Some of the members of the food cooperative are pragmatists, whereas others are idealists. An individual would have difficulties to integrate these two mindsets within one cognitive frame, but by "outsourcing" the other side of the paradox to another group of members, the organization can follow both approaches; further, the members of the food cooperative feel like they follow both groups approach, which is imperative for maintaining the hybrid identity of the the inherently paradoxical organization. Smith and Besharov (2019) explore the case of a social enterprise. This enterprise has both a business and a social mission. Whenever the organization strays to far from one of the goals, the organization "bumps against guard rails", reminding the organization of the hybrid identity of the organization and causing its members to place more emphasis on the other mission again. Thereby, the organization is able to pursue two contradicting goals, emphasizing a different goal at different points of time.

"Both & And" as compared to either/or (which would be dilemma or dialectics).
