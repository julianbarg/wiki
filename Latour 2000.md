# @Latour2000

## One-paragraph summary

Latour defending STS against criticism from sociology. The purpose of STS is not to "destroy" the sciences. Latour claims that social scientists are afraid that "a social explanation destroys its object", e.g., applicable to religion. Similarly, critical analysis of sciences is problematic for social scientists when they take science as a model that presumably has "mastered" its subject.
