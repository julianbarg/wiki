## Aftermath/learning

## My reactions
* Maybe I should adjust my expectations. If we could stop chemical plants and other facilities in Texas from randomly exploding all the time, that would already be a relatively great achievement. Move the goalpost. Overall though - let's not generalize. Learning is possible if intentionally pursued.
* Disaster could have been much, much greater [see @NTSB1993 pp. 7f].

## Various
* "He stopped his truck a short distance before the swale and turned the ignition switch off. He said that when the pickup continued to run, 'I knew something serious had happened" because "there was enoughgasin the air to keep feeding my engine.'" [@NTSB1993 p. 4].
* Interesting insights into how organizational memory works [see @NTSB1993 pp. 25f.]. One can immediately imagine how understanding of the system gradually gets lost in this game of telephone. Clear lack of documentation. See also [[resources|Seminole '92#Organizational-memory]].
