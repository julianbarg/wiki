## One-page summary
This paper provides a meta-analysis to address three ongoing debates in institutional theory. Most institutional theorists have agreed with two theoretical arguments that 1) neoclassical economists or rational choice political scientists’ perspectives are undersocialized, meaning that their conception of organization action hugely ignores the effect of social structure, and 2) the source of organizational action is exogenous to organizations. Yet, there are three core debates in institutional theory dividing scholars into several “scholarly coalitions”.  

### Hypotheses 
First, many scholars have tried to explore whether organizational action is determined by the social structure or by the organizational agency, so called “the structure versus agency debate.” The structure-side perspective follows the classic theoretical backgrounds of institutional theory that, as the structure of organizational fields gets established, institutional pressures (coercive, mimetic, and normative) reduce variation in organizational action. By contrast, the agency-side perspective argues that strong institutional/isomorphic pressures make organizations to resist and protest against social norms. To show how the collection of prior empirical data give evidence for which perspective, the authors construct the structure hypothesis: 

**Hypothesis 1.** The degrees of coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures in an organizational field are positively related to the degree of isomorphism in that field. 

Second, the relationship between isomorphism and performance has been differently conjectured by institutional theorists. While consensus exists among scholars that isomorphism has a positive effect on organizations’ symbolic performance (social evaluations), two different arguments exist in explain the effect of isomorphism on organizations’ substantive performance (accounting-based profits or market value). Conformance scholars, including Meyer and Rowan (1977), suggest that isomorphism is negatively related to substantive performance because isomorphic actions are costly, inefficient, and potentially making organizations hardly compete with their competitors. The other group of scholars do not believe there is a dichotomy between conformance-enhancing actions and performance-enhancing actions. There are reasons why isomorphic actions lead organizations to increase their substantive performance: Isomorphic actions are better than deviant actions when it comes to do any business and attract resource providers. In addition to that, isomorphic strategies allow organizations to do differentiation strategies later (Deephouse, 1999). As the authors suggested the first hypothesis earlier, they construct the set of two hypotheses explaining performance.  

**Hypothesis 2a.** The conformist adoption of isomorphic templates for organizing by focal organizations is positively related to their symbolic performance. 

**Hypothesis 2b.** The conformist adoption of isomorphic templates for organizing by focal organizations is negatively related to their substantive performance. 
 
Third and lastly, the relationship between field–level factors and the level of isomorphism is one remaining issue in institutional theory. Different from the above two issues, the relationship between field-level factors and the level of isomorphism has not been concerns for scholars because there is one coherent theoretical direction between two: field-level measures are expected to affect organizations in a field regardless of each organization’s scores on related organization-level measures (Dimaggio and Powell, 1983). But, the theoretical relationship suggested has hardly been empirically tested because of limited data. To solve this problem, the authors use meta-analysis approach, integrating all the prior studies’ data.  

**Hypothesis 3.** Organizational field–level factors moderate the relationship between the degrees of coercive, normative, and mimetic pressures and the degree of isomorphism in a field. 

### Methods and Results 

By using meta-analysis, a quantitative method for combining evidence from different studies, this paper tests the above hypotheses. The meta-analysis has shown that isomorphic pressures cause organizations to become more homogenous, but weakly (H1 is supported). It also supports that conformance positively influences symbolic/substantive performance of organizations (H2a is supported; H2b is rejected). Lastly, Hypothesis 3 that organizational field–level factors moderate the level of isomorphism is supported.
