## Important points
* Lays out the behavioral approach to learning.

### Basis of organizational learning

* Based on three basic tenets.
1. Behavior in organizations is based on routines.
2. Organizational actions are history-dependent.
3. Organizations are oriented to targets.
* In addition, success vs. failure in outcomes overshadows gradations of either.
* Experience is then translated into routines.

### Main processes

1. Trial-and-error experimentation
* Translated into routines if trial leads to success.

## One-paragraph summary

Levitt and March's approach to learning, which includes a concern for what is being learned why, paves the way for a behavioral approach to learning. They take serious the limitations to learning. For instance, organizations are more likely to learn by what affects the organization, which might diverge from macro-level trends. And it is for instance thinkable under the "right" circumstances that an organization learns and unlearns the same thing (possibly multiple times) - implying that learning is non-linear.
