## Resources

## Important points
* Lays out the behavioral approach to learning.
* Mentions both knowledge and behavior/routines, but the primacy is clearly given to routines. *Note*: Knowledge is the result of an experiment (or search) and routines are how the knowledge is retained (or not)
* Makes me think that the difference between March and Argote may just be the level of analysis - although March also mentions experience curves. Maybe it is just that Argote does not consider competency traps.

### Basis of organizational learning

* Based on three basic tenets. (1) Behavior in organizations is based on routines. (2) Organizational actions are history-dependent. (3) Organizations are oriented to targets.
* In addition, success vs. failure in outcomes overshadows gradations of either.
* Experience is then translated into routines.

### Main processes

1. Trial-and-error experimentation; translated into routines if trial leads to success.
2. Search; search is also dependent on organization's history - through richness of pool, intensity and direction of search.

### Direct experience

* Learning curve
* Competency traps
    * Multilevel learning: discriminating among routines, and refining those routines.

### Interpretation

* **Stories, paradigms and frames**. *Note*: Diverging interpretations may be peddled by opposing groups, may surface at different time.
* **Ambiguity of success**
* **Superstitious learning**. *Note*: Occurs when connection between experience and learning is not faulty. E.g., a company that is always successful for environmental reasons will attribute this to its selected routines.

### Organizational memory

* Recording of experience
    * Methods of recording experience: "documents, accounts, files, standard operating procedures, and rule books; in the social and physical geography of organizational structures and relationships; in standards of good professional practice; in the culture of organizational stories; and in shared perceptions of 'the way things are done around here.'" (p. 327).
    * Authors do not specify how much experience is and can be recorded, but (1) recording history incurs a cost, (2) some events are implicitly or explicitly deemed irrelevant, and (3) organizations have different base levels of formal routines, based on their needs/environment.

* **Conservation of experience**. *Note*: After experience is recorded, needs to be conserved (passed on): "Written rules, oral transitions, and systems of formal and informal apprenticeships" (p. 328).
* **Retrieval of experience**. *Note*: Notion of deterioration of routines precedes Argote's (2013) notion of organizational forgetting.

### Vicarious learning

* Vicarious learning occurs through "encoded experience in the form of technologies, codes, procedures, or similar routines" (p. 329). Levitt and March liken it to institutionalization.
* Mechanisms for Diffusion
    1. "[R]ules promulgated by governmental agencies, trade associations, professional associations, and unions" (p. 330; coercive)
    2. Mediated learning, e.g., through consultants or personnel that moves between organizations (mimetic)
    3. By becoming a norm within a subgroup and them spreading (normative)
* Dynamics of diffusion

### Ecologies of Learning

Linking cause and effect for the purpose of learning becomes even more complicated when other organizations around you are also experimenting at the same time.

* Learning in a world of learners - basically just pointing out that competitors' choices matter as much as a focal organization's choices.
* Learning to learn - some basic thoughts on dynamic capabilities/RBV.

### Learning as a Form of Intelligence

Organization try to deliberately foster learning, but there are multiple barriers. (a) When the environment changes, experience becomes irrelevant; (b) redundancy of experience problem - experience stabilizes routines, extinguishes experimentation; (c) complexity of experience problem - causality is hard or impossible to determine.

* Improving the structure of experience - mentions e.g., ideas later explored in March and Tamuz (1991). Main point - what pace should experimentation take place? Supposedly so that cause & effect can be isolated - slow!?
* The intelligence of learning - "[T]here is adequate evidence that the lessons of history as encoded in routines are an important basis for the intelligence of organizations" (p. 336). But are they one-trick ponies? Are they stuck in their way once they find one way that works? Why is James G. March so certain? 

## One-paragraph summary

Levitt and March use the opportunity of writing a literature review to share their conception of organizational learning. The article does not attempt to develop a concise theory of organizational learning, but rather touches on a plethora of different topics. Important ideas include: (1) organizations learn from experience and search. (2) At some level, learning by doing exhibits itself in learning curves. But organizations may just "learn themselves into" competency traps. (3) A barrier to learning is that cause and effect are difficult to determine - individuals distort interpretations according to their interests, there is no universal method for measuring success, and even success is given, it is hard to map any one outcome to its specific cause. (3) Experience is stored in routines as the organizational memory. (4) Additional repositories for learning are the experiences of others. (5) But in a world where everybody learns, learning from others does not guarantee success. (6) If organizations are afforded the capability to learn by our theory, we may also believe in a form of organizational intelligence - if only at the population-level, not at the level of the individual organization.

## One-page summary

Levitt and March present us with a dissection of organizational learning, but the main part focuses on competency traps. They explain that organizational learning both functions for selecting routines, and simultaneously they refine those routines on lower organizational levels. That leads to the curious outcome that alternative routines might not be selected, even if they have to potential to be more efficient, because the current routine has become efficient through refinement (*maladaptive specialiation*).

Levitt and March's approach to organizational learning, which includes a concern for what is being learned why, paves the way for a behavioral approach to learning. They take serious the limitations to learning. For instance, organizations are more likely to learn by what affects the organization, which might diverge from macro-level trends. And it is for instance thinkable under the "right" circumstances that an organization learns and unlearns the same thing (possibly multiple times) - implying that learning is non-linear.
