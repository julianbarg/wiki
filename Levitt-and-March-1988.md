## Important points
* Lays out the behavioral approach to learning.
* Mentions both knowledge and behavior/routines, but the primacy is clearly given to routines. *Note*: Knowledge is the result of an experiment (or search) and routines are how the knowledge is retained (or not)

### Basis of organizational learning

* Based on three basic tenets. (1) Behavior in organizations is based on routines. (2) Organizational actions are history-dependent. (3) Organizations are oriented to targets.
* In addition, success vs. failure in outcomes overshadows gradations of either.
* Experience is then translated into routines.

### Main processes

1. Trial-and-error experimentation; translated into routines if trial leads to success.
2. Search; search is also dependent on organization's history - through richness of pool, intensity and direction of search.

### Direct experience

* Learning curve
* Competency traps
    * Multilevel learning: discriminating among routines, and refining those routines.

### Interpretation

* **Stories, paradigms and frames**. *Note*: Diverging interpretations may be peddled by opposing groups, may surface at different time.
* **Ambiguity of success**
* **Superstitious learning**. *Note*: Occurs when connection between experience and learning is not faulty. E.g., a company that is always successful for environmental reasons will attribute this to its selected routines.

### Organizational memory

* Recording of experience
    * Methods of recording experience: "documents, accounts, files, standard operating procedures, and rule books; in the social and physical geography of organizational structures and relationships; in standards of good professional practice; in the culture of organizational stories; and in shared perceptions of 'the way things are done around here.'" (p. 327).
    * Authors do not specify how much experience is and can be recorded, but:
        1. Recording history incurs a cost
        2. Some events are implicitly or explicitly deemed irrelevant
        3. Organizations have different base levels of formal routines, based on their needs/environment

* **Conservation of experience**. *Note*: After experience is recorded, needs to be conserved (passed on): "Written rules, oral transitions, and systems of formal and informal apprenticeships" (p. 328).
* **Retrieval of experience**. *Note*: Notion of deterioration of routines precedes Argote's (2013) notion of organizational forgetting.

#### Vicarious learning

* Vicarious learning occurs through "encoded experience in the form of technologies, codes, procedures, or similar routines" (p. 329).
* Mechanisms for Diffusion
    1. "[R]ules promulgated by governmental agencies, trade associations, professional associations, and unions" (p. 330).
    2. Mediated learning, e.g., through consultants or personnel that moves between organizations.
    3. The third is literally institutional theory?!

## One-paragraph summary

Levitt and March present us with a dissection of organizational learning, but the main part focuses on competency traps. They explain that organizational learning both functions for selecting routines, and simultaneously they refine those routines on lower organizational levels. That leads to the curious outcome that alternative routines might not be selected, even if they have to potential to be more efficient, because the current routine has become efficient through refinement (*maladaptive specialiation*).

Levitt and March's approach to organizational learning, which includes a concern for what is being learned why, paves the way for a behavioral approach to learning. They take serious the limitations to learning. For instance, organizations are more likely to learn by what affects the organization, which might diverge from macro-level trends. And it is for instance thinkable under the "right" circumstances that an organization learns and unlearns the same thing (possibly multiple times) - implying that learning is non-linear.
