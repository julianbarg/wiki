## One-page summary
In this paper, the author develops a theory of power relations that can be used to examine different issue such as status, M&A, coalition formation, group norms, role prescriptions and many others. The author recognizes that there is a problem in the way people view power as people treat power as though it were an attribute associated with a person or a group. The author argues that *power is a result of social relationships formed between actors*, and depending on the relationships, one actor can have more or less power. Using exchange relationship as an example, the author argues that "power to control or influence the other resides in control over the things that the others value", thereby arguing that power of an entity (A) over another entity (B) depends on how much more B depends on A (than A depends on B). This dependence is said to be a function of 1) motivational investment and 2) alternatives. Furthermore, the author also provides definitions of *power advantage* (difference between the amount of power A has over B and the power B has over A), *cohesion* (the average of dependence of A on B, and dependence of B on A), and *balancing operations* (changes in the structure of power-dependence relations that reduces power imbalance).  

After establishing the theoretical base of power and dependence relationship, the author provide two broad ways actors can reduce the power imbalance: 1) cost reduction and 2) balancing operations. Cost reduction involves the less powerful party reducing the cost associated with meeting the demand of the more powerful counterpart. Since use of power entails forcing the other party to engage in a behavior that is contrary to their own goals (thus costly), the less powerful party can reduce the costs related to conforming to the demand of the more powerful party. While this method does not change the structure of the dependence relationship, balancing operations tactic aims to fundamentally change the underlying dependence relationship. The author further breaks down balancing operations into four different types: 1) withdrawal, 2) extension of power network, 3) use of status, and 4) coalition formation.  

In withdrawal, the less powerful (more dependent) entity (ie. A) reduces their dependence on the other party (ie. B) through such measures as denial, and as a result reduces power of B over A. With extension of power network, B brings in another entity, C, to reduce the dependence (similar to increasing the number of alternatives). Using status, groups award status recognitions to more powerful members as an alternative means to maintain them in the relationship. Finally, with coalition formation, less powerful entities (ie. A and C) build coalitions to increase their level of importance in dealing with a more powerful entity.  

In this paper, the author provides both descriptive accounts of power relationships among entities and prescriptive suggestions on the actions that can be taken by less powerful entities. By doing so, it offers a perspective of thinking about mergers and how firms may navigate different power dynamics. Furthermore, by defining power as a "property of the social relation" and developing a theory of power relations based on the level of dependence within an exchange relationship, the article provides a foundation for the resource dependence theory.
