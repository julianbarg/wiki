## Important points

## One-paragraph summary

Individuals have a "propensity to evoke cogni- tions which restructure oneÕs actions to appear less harmful, minimize oneÕs understanding of responsi- bility for oneÕs actions, or attenuate the perception of the distress one causes others" (ibid., 129). That is why, without major distress, individuals are able to engage in inhumane behavior. Moral disengagement is a prime driver of individuals partaking in corruption, mediated by moral awareness.
