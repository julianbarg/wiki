## Expert interview

* "When I read some of the studies on oil spills, I get the impression that in the long-term, these events are not too concerning..."?
* Interaction of oil spills with other stressors, such as fertilizer runoff
* Impact of increased availability of foodstuff on the prevalence of oil degrading bacteria
    * Potential adverse impacts, compare fertilizer runoff
    * Food chain impacts
* Studies focus on animal _survival_, what about other dangers, e.g., damage to DNA
* Risk from spilled oil to acuifers
* What do you think, are some/most of your collegues more/less critical of oil spills?
* "potential risks of acute and chronic toxic effects on benthic organisms and possibly less biodegradation once the oil is deposited" (Fitzpatrick et al. 2015)--vis a vis benefits of dispersion
    * Ethical implications of enhancing physical dispersion
