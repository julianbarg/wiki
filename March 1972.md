# @March1972

## One-paragraph summary

March's classic paper about the need for the models we generate to be true, beautiful, and just. The first part explains how models generated by social science can corrupt culture. For instance, if our model implies that unconcious motives underlie all human action, the consequence is that we should be cautious of others' intentions--more paranoid!

Next, March introduces (1) the _relativist_ and (2) _rationalist_ bias. The _relativist_ bias states that preferences--where justice often comes into play--is routinely treated as exogenous to models, and excluded from debate. The _rationalist_ bias entails the belief that purpose antedates action, where in fact the two emerge simultaneously. Then, March re-introduces the rational model of choice, and his own model of discovery of goals. If we adopt a model that does not assume goals as pre-existent, we can do great things with that. Rather than be a subject to our consistent and permanent goals, we can engage in the construction of new goals to guide our behavior. March emphasizes the importance of foolishness for discovery. One pathway to foolishness is playfulness.

Great article, picking up March's theme of foolishness as a means again. On the other hand--as he admits in March (2006)--there is no reason to believe that foolishness leads us to preferable outcomes more often than it leads us to disasters. Foolishness can deprive us of something we have learned before without the need for it. We can abandon potentially sustainable materials such a wood, or replace reusable materials such as glas with plastics. Foolishness, in a way, is March's grand narrative, the one concept that gives him hope and guides history toward better, more creative outcomes.

## Notes

* "Independent of its truth value, a model has a justice value" (p. 414).
