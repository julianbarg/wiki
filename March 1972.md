# @March1972

## One-paragraph summary

March's classic paper about the need for the models we generate to be true, beautiful, and just. The first part explains how models generated by social science can corrupt culture. For instance, if our model implies that unconcious motives underlie all human action, the consequence is that we should be cautious of others' intentions--more paranoid!

Next, March introduces (1) the _relativist_ and (2) _rationalist_ bias. The _relativist_ bias states that preferences--where justice often comes into play--is routinely treated as exogenous to models, and excluded from debate. The _rationalist_ bias entails the belief that purpose antedates action, where in fact the two emerge simultaneously.

## Notes

* "Independent of its truth value, a model has a justice value" (p. 414).
