# @March1972

## One-paragraph summary

March's classic paper about the need for the models we generate to be true, beautiful, and just. The first part explains how models generated by social science can corrupt culture. For instance, if our model implies that unconcious motives underlie all human action, the consequence is that we should be cautious of others' intentions--more paranoid!

## Notes

* "Independent of its truth value, a model has a justice value" (p. 414).
