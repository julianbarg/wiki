## Sustainability/Viability

Use the language of sustainability/viabilidity to illustrate reliability/validity to another audience. Operating a coal power plant may not be sustainable in the long term, but for now it is viable--there are coal power plants being operated right now. That is because the operators rely on reliable knowledge. Valid knowledge might tell us that it is a bad idea, but politics and the broader population would not disagree or stop the operation of those plants.
