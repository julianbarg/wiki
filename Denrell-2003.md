## One-paragraph summary

Companies learn from other organizations; in particular, they try to emulate successful organizations. This article centers on the assumption that we undersample failure. The authors show that when only companies with a positive performance survive, it will seem like risk is associated with better performance - because risk-takers that did not survive have been selected out.
