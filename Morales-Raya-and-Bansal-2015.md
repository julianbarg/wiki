## One-paragraph summary
Qualitative study of Coca-Cola's and PepsiCo's speed of decision making. The authors point out that a high speed of decision making leads to temporal myopia, an inattentional blindness to important information, and stymies learning. Thereby, a high speed can contribute to costly mishaps. As indicators of speed, the study uses CEO turnover, the number of M&As and strategic alliances, as well as yearly average of shares turnover. Organizational mishaps are collected from the WSJ, and taken from KLD.
