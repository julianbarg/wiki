### Contribution 
This paper uses the resource-partitioning model of organizational ecology to explain why and how specialists such as microbreweries emerged after generalists such as mass-production brewing companies had dominated the whole beer industry. The paper has two contributions towards organizational ecology. First, the authors show that under specific boundary conditions, a dynamic relationship between generalists and specialists exists. This dynamic relationship explains the sequential occurrence of mass-production (hence the brewing companies’ market concentration) and the emergence of specialty brewers. The approach stands in contrast to the original niche theory paper ([[Hannan & Freeman 1977]]), in which the authors only look at the interaction between organizations and their environment. Different organizational forms (such as generalists and specialists) are not though of as interacting with one another, instead, each form is selected out (or in) based on environmental condition. Second, the authors suggest a new “identity” mechanism of the resource-partitioning model. In the mature U.S. beer industry, which emerged after a fierce scale-based selection period, a new niche for high-status specialist (microbreweries was created and in full flourish. Even though major breweries tried to occupy the niche, microbreweries) emerged and could grow constantly because consumers thought major breweries and microbreweries were different in terms of their identities. In other words, the beer market was “partitioned”. Originating from this paper, "identity” has become one important factor that divides market segments or resource spaces where firms are located.  

### Summary 
First, to show generalists’ market concentration, the author explains the crowding phenomenon among organizations, which assumes that there are generalists and specialists competing each other. Initially, generalists, occupying the market center, out-compete specialists which occupy small spots in the resource space’s periphery. However, as market concentration rises, specialists will have the opportunity to occupy thin locations which generalists do not have their eyes on.  

**H1**: market concentration ratio → the founding rate of specialist orgs (+) / mortality rate of specialist orgs (-) 

This is because generalists usually focus on each other because of scale-based selection pressure.  

**H2**: distance from larger competitors on a size gradient → org mortality rate (+) 

Of course, generalists that own high quality products outperform specialists. Yet, under resource partitioning processes that are based on “identity”, a group of specialists that has already established its identity holds an advantage during the legitimation process. 

**H3**: org form density → the legitimating effects of specialist org form (+) 

Consequently, both specialists and generalists tend to occupy distinct (partitioned) resource niches. In the setting of the U.S. beer industry, the authors find empirical support for their hypotheses.
