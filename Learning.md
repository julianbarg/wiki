## Thoughts

On [[Dutton Thomas and Butler 1984]]: The authors propagate that we see continuous improvements in productivity, which (partially) explains our economic growth. Is there a limit to **this kind of** economic "growth"? We are increasingly improving *meta-routines*. For instance management software such as SAP, software that allows for quick iterating in product development such as CAD, or efficient supply chain, and last but not least robots for production. Thus, learning has reached a new quality. Is there a ceiling?
