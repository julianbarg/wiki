### Notes
* Weak theoretical foundations

### Main points: Technology and (long-term) planning
* (Long-term) planning have come up in the literature for a long time. [[Dutton and Thomas 1984]] for instance use planning to exemplify their proposed transition toward a learning (curve) literature that studies organizational behavior, and its effect on learning rates (or, as they still called it "progress rates").
* Technology has also been found in the literature, going back to learning rates, as an import factor, but it has been studied less systematically as a cause of learning.

### What kind of theory is called for
I am looking for a theory that is not deterministic, but also not fatalistic. On the one hand, we should not assume that any change (to technology or policy) is necessarily positive and will improve productivity (or the other way around). On the other hand, if a change occurred and is reversed later, we also may not assume that the outcome of this development is negative - the organization may have learned something along the way, and may be better off for it.
