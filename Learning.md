### Main points: Technology and (long-term) planning
* (Long-term) planning have come up in the literature for a long time. [[Dutton and Thomas 1984]] for instance use planning to exemplify their proposed transition toward a learning (curve) literature that studies organizational behavior, and its effect on learning rates (or, as they still called it "progress rates").
* Technology has also been found in the literature, going back to learning rates, as an import factor, but it has been studied less systematically as a cause of learning.
