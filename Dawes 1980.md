## Notes

* "Given the ubituity of social dillemmas--and the global importance of some of them--the question arises of how individuals and societies can deal with them. One answer is that they can't. The role of the social theorist is to point out where dilemmas exist and then to watch everyone defect--verifying the hypothesis that a social dilemma is indeed there."
