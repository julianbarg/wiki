_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

## One-sentence summary

Dawes discusses the tragedy of the commons. Using empirical examples such as the prisoner's dilemma, he argues that actors in dilemmas, including the tragedy of the commons, do not act to maximize utility (at least not in the sense; p. 176). Rather, altruism, conscience and noms, involvement, communication, group size, anonymity, expectations, and moralizing all play a role.

## Notes

* "The point is that if a person chooses action A over action B, then A must (by definition) have greater utility; if simultaneously action B provides a higher social payoff in terms of economic benefits or security, then (again by definition) other utilities must be guiding the individual's choice." (p. 176).
* "Given the ubituity of social dillemmas--and the global importance of some of them--the question arises of how individuals and societies can deal with them. One answer is that they can't. The role of the social theorist is to point out where dilemmas exist and then to watch everyone defect--verifying the hypothesis that a social dilemma is indeed there" (p. 174).
