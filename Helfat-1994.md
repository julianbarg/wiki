### Contribution 
This paper, using a unique R&D expenditure data, shows an empirical proof of the propositions from Evolutionary Theory by Nelson and Winter (1982). There are several contributions that the author has made to the Evolutionary Theory literature. First, the data used in this work demonstrates very well how energy firms follow “evolutionary trajectories”. This longitudinal FRS data classifies firm-level R&D activities into distinct R&D subcategories, helping the author to show whether firms persistently keep their routines or not. Second, the paper reaches its methodological rigor by using different methods such as correlation and regressions, including Tobit and fixed-effects. Third, the paper lists the advantages of evolutionary theory over “orthodox” economic models, stating that the orthodox models may prove each hypothesis with their logics but fail to give an integrated explanation on the whole phenomenon.

### Summary  
Contrary to what neoclassical economists predict, evolutionary theorists argue that firms differ from each other (in this paper, focusing on R&D activities) even within a single market environment for the following reasons.  

First, (**Hypothesis 1**) a firm’s current and past efforts in each R&D activity are positively correlated. This is because 1) a firm itself is so bounded-rational that it cannot easily move to new options and 2) a firm searches new options based on what it has learned before. Second, (**Hypothesis 2**) if current and past efforts in an R&D activity within a firm are positively correlated, this results from a process of incremental adjustment of R&D activity over time. The paper comes up with this hypothesis to prove that the positive correlation predicted by H1 is a result of the incremental R&D change, not the same R&D activities over time.  

Third, since Firms have different knowledge bases and learning paths, (**Hypothesis 3**) for a given R&D activity, the level of a firm’s effort differs from that of other firms. (**Hypothesis 4**) The levels of investment on R&D activities will differ within firms. The empirical analysis of R&D expenditures in the petroleum industry generally supports the above hypotheses. The dependent variable is R&D intensity, not R&D expenditures themselves. In the analysis, the author confirms the idea of Evolutionary Theory that firms persistently sustain their routines, which differ from another firm. The paper also provides statistical evidence ranging from simple statistics like correlation and mean/variance to Tobit/Fixed-effects regression results.      

### Criticism
Due to limitations of the data used, this paper’s argument cannot be generalized to other fields. Researchers may need to look at (uncontrolled) industry-level factors which caused the petroleum firms to follow evolutionary trajectories in R&D. Moreover, researchers may want to conduct a follow-up study of this paper, checking which routines survive after the 20 years that have passed since the paper has been published. This is because retention is not sufficient to prove evolutionary theory, rather selection and variation should be demonstrated also. For future researches, I think there are plenty of routines that organizations rely on and continue to follow as their identity. For example, it may be interesting to look at the stickiness of organizational structure, marketing strategy and CEO profile. One last question regarding the Evolutionary theory literature is about normative statements. I am not sure whether this theory is able to make any normative claims for firms or decision makers.
