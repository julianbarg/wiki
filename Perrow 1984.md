* (P. 313) "Active risk" vs. "passive risk" - Risk we actively engage in (e.g., driving) vs. risk we have to accept when engaging in and activity (e.g., airtravel). Perrow suggests that the profit for passive risk is often accrued to private businesses, while consumers may benefit from active risks (e.g., commuting in exchange for making an income).
* (P. 337) Prof. Pidford both accepts the propaganda sign that says "Nuclear Power Is Safe" and yet acknowledges that "There is no such thing as no accidents". Maybe, the group of people that believe that imperfection in plant conditions is acct able is the same group that believes that plants are safe and the populace should accept them rather than being "unreasonable". These sentiments seem to go hand in hand, suggesting an that the discourse is dominated by ideology really. Maybe if we did away with the ideology (of safety), we could make some actual progress.
