## Thoughts
* An inhibition of opposing ideas also has its justification, as it supports coherence and allows for an organization to push in one direction, and overcome obstacles in that path. If you do something, you may fail in that endaveour, but if you do not try something, you have already failed. How should the organization know whether with regard to a particular issue, this norm should be broken?
