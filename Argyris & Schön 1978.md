## Concepts

### Organizational maps

"[S]hared decriptions of organization [sic, ... which] include, for example, diagrams of work flow, compensation charts, statements of procedure, even the schematic drawings of office space" [@argyris1978 p. 17].

### Single-loop learning

* "There is a single feed-back loop which connects detected outcomes of action to organizational strategies and assumptions which are modified so as to keep organizational performance within the range set by organizational norms. The norms themselves--for product quality, sales, or task performance--remain unchanged" [@argyris1978 pp. 18f].

### Organizational learning

* "Organizational learning occurs when individuals, acting from their images and maps, detect a match or mismatch of outcome to expectation which confirms or disconfirms organizational theory-in-use. [...] But in order for organizational learning to occur, learning agents' discoveries, inventions, and evaluations must be embedded in organizational memory." [@argyris1978 pp. 19].

### Theory-in-use

* Conceptualization of the organization that guides members' day-to-day activities in the organization.
* Encoded in organizational memory [@argyris1978 p. 20].

## Chapter by chapter summary

### Chapter one

Gives an overview over organizational memory and organizational learning. Organizational norms, strategies and assumptions constitute the organizations _theory of action_. The organization also possesses a more tacit _theory-in-use_--which may sometimes conflict with the _theory of action_.

## Important points
* "[T]he very information needded to detect and correct erros becomes undiscussable" (pp. 3f).
* Critical view of learning (p. 9).
* The organization's _theory of action_ includes norms, strategies, and assumptions.
* Individuals correct organizational maps when outcomes do not match expectations (p. 18).

## Reactions
* An inhibition of opposing ideas also has its justification, as it supports coherence and allows for an organization to push in one direction, and overcome obstacles in that path. If you do something, you may fail in that endaveour, but if you do not try something, you have already failed. How should the organization know whether with regard to a particular issue, this norm should be broken?
