## Sampling strategy

1. Complete overall timeline of Keystone XL approval process
2. Identify forums
    - Initial sampling takes place here
3. Identify action around forum
    - Leading up to, and following after
    - Text /w epistemology is only a part of that
    - Incidentially, get a glimpse of what epistemology is part of, bigger context
    - Sampling until theoretical saturation?
4. Triangulate through interviews

## Analytic strategy

* There are a set of events that are either puzzling or revealing
    - Focus on these first
* Who do I need to attend to
    - Forum, participant, or event
    - Sample forums--theorical strategy--different places, points in time, participants there is less diversity
* Jerry Taylor--the epistemology does not matter when actor focus on outcomes
* I don't need a random sample, I need vivid example. 
* Broaden the idea of an epistemology--epistemology of what?

## Points

* Focus on ideas might seem to structural
* Actors not only take action by translating and generating new ideas
* They also drive process by influencing discourse through action
    * Outcomes, not just ideas drive perception of the world and impact institutions
    * E.g., successful permit application of KXL sends important signals to observers
