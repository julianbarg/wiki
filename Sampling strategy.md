## Sampling strategy

1. Complete overall timeline of Keystone XL approval process
2. Identify forums
    - Initial sampling takes place here
3. Place forums in context--flow of events/decisions
    - How to set cut-off points?
    - Saturation?
4. Sample before/after of particiant-produced text
    - This and forums is the discourse
    

## Analytic strategy

* There are a set of events that are either puzzling or revealing
    - Focus on these first
* Who do I need to attend to
    - Forum, participant, or event
    - Sample forums--theorical strategy--different places, points in time, participants there is less diversity

### Questions

* What if one stream happens to encompass multiple forums?

## Points

* Focus on ideas might seem to structural
* Actors not only take action by translating and generating new ideas
* They also drive process by influencing discourse through action
