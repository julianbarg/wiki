### Goal of the paper

1. The academic conversation that this paper enters into is relevant to the usefulness of managers. Do managers matter, or are they just “rubber stamps” who simply decide the best strategy given organizational constraints? 

2. The research question is, “does managerial attention to new technology influence the timing of the incumbent’s entry into the new technological market?”

### Findings
The effect of CEOs differs depending on the focus of their attention—accelerating entry when attention is directed to the emerging technology or the affected industry and slowing response when attention is directed to the existing technology. The effect of attention to the emerging technological opportunity is also dependent on the level of organizational orientation—the capabilities, complementary assets, and attendant incentives—a firm has toward the affected industry. 

### Discussions
Strategic action is shaped by how managers notice and interpret change, and then translate those perspectives into strategic choice. 

Some researchers have attributed the heterogeneity of firm actions to differences in dynamic capabilities that either constrain or enable a firm to put together new resources to address the new product market.  

However, this study shows firms with the same organizational capabilities, but heterogeneity in CEO attention can lead to different firm actions. This implies scholars need to take and/both firm level (organizational capability) and manager level (managerial cognition) are critical in determining firm actions. Focusing on either one of the levels cannot fully account for heterogeneity in firm action.
