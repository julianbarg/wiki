## One-page summary
The premise that resource dependence theory has remained a metaphor and not a prominent theory, is because of the ambiguities. The theory’s central proposition is that organizational survival hinges on the ability to procure critical resources from the external environment. Key tactic explained by Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) is constraint absorption. However, constraint absorption by a dependent organization, will mean compromise of power by the constraining organization, which is not the same. This is a limitation of resource dependence. 

### Sources of ambiguity in extant operationalization of resource dependence theory

1. Constraint absorption does not discriminate between two dyadic power constructs from Emerson (1962) exchange theory, i.e. power imbalance and mutual dependence. Rather these were combined into concept of interdependence. 

2. Because of lack of distinction, the theory does not account for the different outcomes of the two dimensions. Mutual dependence will make both firms likely to cooperate, and will facilitate constraint absorption. While power imbalance, will be a hinderance to this, as the less powerful firm will oppose the move.  
3. Boundary conditions. Constraint absorption, interorganizational operations to restructure dependencies, and exercise of power are not the same tactics, and will render different results. 
4. Despite being dyadic in nature, empirically the theory has been tested one sidedly, from perspective of one actor, without considering reciprocity.  


Through this article, the authors posit to conceptualize power and dependence as two distinct dimensions following Emersion (1962). Accordingly, 

a) Power and dependence are inversely related. 

b) A's dependence on B is reliant on: 

* proportion of A's need for resources that B can provide.

* Inverse proportion of availability of alternatives to A, who can provide same resources as B.

 

In the same lines, the authors present two dimensions, Power Imbalance and Mutual Dependence.  

* Power imbalance: The relative power of more powerful to the less powerful 

* Mutual dependence: sum / average of A’s dependence on B, and B’s dependence on A. Higher the sum, higher mutual dependence, lower the sum lower mutual dependence. 

With this conceptualization the authors posit that there would be inverse effect of power imbalance and mutual dependence on the constraint absorption. Where, power imbalance will negatively impact the likelihood of constraint absorption, while mutual dependence will positively impact the likelihood of constraint absorption. The authors test this hypothesis for mergers and acquisitions, with level as well as unit of analysis being industry (rather than firm). The authors find support for the hypothesis, however the effect of interaction between power imbalance and mutual dependence was not significant.
