## One-paragraph summary

Observing how organizations construct increasingly complex, yet efficient, heuristics. Drawing a distinction between routines and heuristics. Heuristics, while idiosyncratic, share a common structure (i.e., seleciton, procedural, temporal, and priority; pp. 1457f). Heuristics "effectively proxy for complex, correlated information" (p. 1458), whereas information-intensive, analytical approaches "tend to 'overfit'" (p. 1459).

* Calling the *knowledge-based approach* to learning the *organizational knowledge* literature (p. 1438). And calling the *behavioral approach* the *organizational routines* literature. That's useful for me. But at the same time, I am not sure I agree with the second one. I am not sure that is e.g., what Levitt and March (1988) is all about.
* Are we just justifying our own tendency to make judgement calls when confronted with a problem? To try to focus on "what's important", in a subjective manner? On the other hand, when to rigidly following a schematic, people miss what's important? Vague rules can capture that better?
* This paper is everything I am worried about--brilliant, but also overselling itself. Talking about things it is not doing. Is it even possible to develop complex, coherent ideas? Or is everything that is complex automatically to specific? The general strategy seems to be to simplify the existing literature, and then create a new term for something that has been talked about before--word games.
