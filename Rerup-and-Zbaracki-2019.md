## One-page summary

The article stretches the great opportunities for learning from rare events as well as the barriers to this learning outcome. On a higher level, (e.g., society) achieving a valid and reliable (public, stable and shared) understanding of the rare event in question poses a great challenge. (This could also be relevant if the organization is not viewed as too exceptional, if one views workings on different levels - group, organization, industry, society - as following similar mechanisms, only with different degrees of complexity.) Specific challenges are superstitious learning, conspiracy theories, and fantasy documents. Most importantly, there are political dynamics that determine the learning outcomes. Stakeholders promote views that benefit them, seemingly with disregard to the truth.

Rare events can be pathbreaking events. Organizations pay more careful attention to them, rather than viewing them as statistical outliers. There are many barriers to learning from rare events, too, though. More barriers may be overcome if, instead of relying valid learning on the organizational level (with the knowledge later being distributed through vicarious learning), the event is interpreted on a population level.

## Notes
* Are there valid and invalid outcomes? Isn't learning still learning, even if it is build on a wrong/questionable/contested premise? Couldn't learning be just a change/evolution in understanding. If we learn something in school, and the scientific consensus later evolves (meaning that textbooks are change) -  does that mean that suddenly in school we have not learned? Do kids learn in school when creationism is taught? And does the question of whether kids learn when they study creationism vs evolution hinge on whether god exists?

Learning is picking up what socially desirable, which is to some degree constrained by what is observable in the physical realm.

This view may not be very intuitive, but it may be beneficial for theorizing. Rather than requiring us to determine which knowledge is valid. Further, if a firm makes performance improvements based on a flawed understanding of the subject matter, wouldn't this still constitute valid learning?

What if learning was just reaction to feedback loops? Learning as measured by performance improvements can still be achieved if the obtained knowledge is valid, as measured by the "next overlaying organizational layer", e.g., the regulator. For instance, pipeline operators might learn that they have to report oil spills, but that they don't have to fear repercussions. Learning pipeline operations would then mean learning to deal with the regulatory framework - not to reduce the number of or prevent completely spills.

Also, rare events can sometimes break long-standing alliances, e.g., political leadership that is supported by the population. It might also break power relationships, e.g., give lower tier employees the opportunity to share beliefs, including those that they have already held before the event (and maybe, they have been ranting about safety for years, although the organization is performing well relative to peers).
