> Current public debate about oil-sands development focuses on individual pipeline decisions. Each is presented as an ultimatum — a binary choice between project approval and lost economic opportunity. This approach artificially restricts discussions to only a fraction of the consequences of oil development, such as short-term economic gains and job creation, and local impacts on human health and the environment. Lost is a broader conversation about national and international energy and economic strategies, and their trade-offs with environmental justice and conservation.

### Introduction--phenomenon & significance

#### Structure

* KXL dominating American public debate
* KXL as a symbol for an institution in the discourse
* KXL as a "thing" [@Latour2005]--signifying oil extraction and associated emissions

#### Draft

Few if any construction projects have been at top of public debate in the US for as long as KXL. [[Presidential candidate Mit Romey listed approving KXL as the first action he would take on his first day of presidency in 2011.|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZofmQyqu-I]] [[Senators regularly listed KXL as their highest priority in elections or tied their future to the project, such as the Democrat Mary Landrieu who failed by one vote in her attempt to get an approval bill for KXL passed, and subsequently lost the run-offs in Louisiana.|https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/18/keystone-xl-mary-landrieus-final-indignity/]] In the 2012 Presidential election, KXL was too hot for the incument--rather than to risk upsetting part of the constiutiency, the State Department announced on November 10, 2011 that a decision on the permit application would be pushed back until 2013. Only in 2016 did the then-outgoing administration dare deny the permit application--as one of the last few _traditionally highly symbolic_ actions. The incoming President in 2017 on day one signed a memorandum to invite the resubmission of the application. And in 2021, the incoming President blocked further construction on his first day in office. The journal _Nature_ has commented on it in editorials not just once, but _six_ times. 

Keystone XL means many things to many. For the American fossil fuel industry, the eventual defeat of KXL meant an "end of major U.S. oil infrastructure" [@Freitas2021]. For the American environmental movement, the defeat of KXL meant that "[t]he fossil-fuel industry's aura of invincibility is gone. They’ve got all the money on the planet, but they no longer have unencumbered political power" [@McKibben2015]. And for the scientific community, the line is a symbol of the "false dichotomy between environmental protection and the economy" [@2011].

<!--It is not unusual that a discourse becomes so entrenched, where the stakes are high.-->

### Introduction--discourse

#### Structure

* Institution--organizations, members, values
* From values, transition to language
* Intangible and volatile character of values in language
* Values and changes thereof manifest themselves in discourse
    * Sometimes, they are relatively stable, when an industry association of professional association literally writes them out in textbooks
    * We observe an institutional field in flux, as new members get involved, and values clash
