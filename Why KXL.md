> Current public debate about oil-sands development focuses on individual pipeline decisions. Each is presented as an ultimatum â€” a binary choice between project approval and lost economic opportunity. This approach artificially restricts discussions to only a fraction of the consequences of oil development, such as short-term economic gains and job creation, and local impacts on human health and the environment. Lost is a broader conversation about national and international energy and economic strategies, and their trade-offs with environmental justice and conservation.

Only in 2016 did the then-outgoing administration dare deny the permit application--as one of the last few _traditionally highly symbolic_ actions. The incoming President in 2017 on day one signed a memorandum to invite the resubmission of the application. And in 2021, the incoming President blocked further construction on his first day in offie.
