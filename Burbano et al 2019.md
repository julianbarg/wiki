* I think since it's such a strongly biased sample, I would like to see a confusion matrix for the test sample. The paper hinges on the labelling of the data, and that could easily go wrong because the sample is so strongly biased. Considering that the sample consists to roughly 90% of non-socially responsible organizations, and also roughly 90% non-socially responsibly products, an AUC of about 0.85 really isnt that impressive. For a balanced sample it would be, but for a relatively strongly biased sample it's not.
* What % of products and organizations were labelled as responsible? Is it a strongly biased sample? In that case, using any form of machine learning to label the data would be problematic (since a model that always recommend one type would achieve a high AUC). I recommend also reporting the confusion matrix for your test set.
* What is the purpose of this article? What idea is really at the center? Do you want to propagate the idea of dissecting CSR?
* Might benefit of a proper definition of social responsibility, that might suffice to explain the discrepancy between perception of the firm and the product as responsible.
* Telling CSR as an optimization story. Is that really what's going on? If this model does not explain what we see very well, maybe it's not a good model.
* Is CSR an external attribution, or an internal feature? Wouldn't all products of a firm use a lot of the same overhead? I can see how products can be partially isolated from each other, but certainly some features, like unethical labor practices, or certain stances of the HQ, would affect all products equally.
* It never occured to me to think of the Prius as a "socially responsible" car. We might think of it as "morally good", but is that the same as socially responsible? Also, that's an external attribution, whereas CSR resides internally (?).
* One implicit assumption is that organizations would not engage in CSR for CSR's sake, which as an assumption I find too sweeping.
