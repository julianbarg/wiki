* What is the purpose of this article? What idea is really at the center? Do you want to propagate the idea of dissecting CSR?
* Might benefit of a proper definition of social responsibility, that might suffice to explain the discrepancy between perception of the firm and the product as responsible.
* Telling CSR as an optimization story. Is that really what's going on? If this model does not explain what we see very well, maybe it's not a good model.
* Is CSR an external attribution, or an internal feature? Wouldn't all products of a firm use a lot of the same overhead? I can see how products can be partially isolated from each other, but certainly some features, like unethical labor practices, or certain stances of the HQ, would affect all products equally.
* It never occured to me to think of the Prius as a "socially responsible" car. We might think of it as "morally good", but is that the same as socially responsible? Also, that's an external attribution, whereas CSR resides internally (?).
* One implicit assumption is that organizations would not engage in CSR for CSR's sake, which as an assumption I find too sweeping.
