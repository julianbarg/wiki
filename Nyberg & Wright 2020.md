# @Nyberg2020

## One-paragraph summary

Management research is uniquely positioned to contribute to climate mitigation. But so far, the research in this intersection is negligible. Wright and Nyberg (re-)introduce the physical challenge. They then argue that lack of relevant research is not due to lag but neglect. In that context, they introduce the concept of denial--very useful! Next, they rehash the debate between environmental management and ecocentrism, very poignant. They summarize their own work (2017) as the "dominant 'sustainability' agenda [being] captured by corporate interests [... legitimizing] increased GHG emissions" (p. 15), a process that is mirrored by management research's ignorance. As a way forward, they offer three concepts: mitigation, adaptation, and suffering, with a rich aray of references. The section on suffering touches on the literature on management of crises--e.g., "making sense of traumatic situations and reducing employee stress" (p. 23).
