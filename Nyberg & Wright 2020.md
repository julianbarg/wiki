# @Nyberg2020

## One-paragraph summary

Management research is uniquely positioned to contribute to climate mitigation. But so far, the research in this intersection is negligible. Wright and Nyberg (re-)introduce the physical challenge. They then argue that lack of relevant research is not due to lag but neglect. Next, they introduce the concept of denial--very useful!
