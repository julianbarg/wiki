## Response to [[Baum and Dahlin 2007]]

I could implement this study with the pipeline data and add inspection habits to show change to behavior/learning.

## Response to [[Madsen and Desai 2018]]

* Historical root of this approach: the famous liberty ship study also concerns a phenomenon where a central actor acted as coordinator/facilitator.
* If I wanted to replicate some of this study, I could create variables for regulatory action?
* What is the role of resources/resource commitments though?
* What I could do is variance decomposition, show for financial damage vs gallons spilled. To show the different priorities in learning.
* To control for profit driven improvements that also affect gallons spilled, I could add improvements to financial damage as a control variable.
* How to carry over ideas from last note: relationship between variable and performance (outcome of interest) is unknown, therefore, effort is based on aspiration level. For instance, in a volatile regulatory environment, terrible performance could have a significant impact on performance. But both impact of action on variable, and impact of variable on performance are unknown.

## Response to [[Gavetti et al 2012]]

* Strong idea I want to capture: learning is the change of routines in response to feedback. What is learned can have a positive impact on the performance metrics that are used by the organization under some environmental conditions, and a negative impact under different conditions. Overall, learning is positive not because organizations become unconditionally superior, but because they are responsive.
* Attention: I could capture attention based on publications by the firm.

* I need to integrate micro and macro!
