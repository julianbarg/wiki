## Response to [[Baum and Dahlin 2007]]

I could implement this study with the pipeline data and add inspection habits to show change to behavior/learning.

## Response to [[Madsen and Desai 2018]]

* Historical root of this approach: the famous liberty ship study also concerns a phenomenon where a central actor acted as coordinator/facilitator.
* If I wanted to replicate some of this study, I could create variables for regulatory action?
* What is the role of resources/resource commitments though?
* What I could do is variance decomposition, show for financial damage vs gallons spilled. To show the different priorities in learning.
