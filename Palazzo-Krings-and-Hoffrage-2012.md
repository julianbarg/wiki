## One-paragraph summary

Ethical blindness functions similar to inattention blindness. Instead of our attention being captivated by something that pulls us away from the thing right in front of our face, the individual, in a sensemaking fashion, is applying a different frame. Only one frame is applied at a time in that case, and the frame is provided by the organization (the individual perceives a routine).
