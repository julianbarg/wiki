## Notes

* Observing a widening acceptance of "sustainable development" paradigm--why?
* Picks up WCED conceptualization to define sustainability as encompassing the three pillars--economic, social, and environmental sustainability
* Corporate environmental management used as a description of WCED-derived activities
* "Corporate environmental management is an effort by firms to reduce the size of their 'ecological footprint.'"--description in line with the original meaning/orthodox use of the terminology.
