## One-paragraph summary
Signifies the move of the literature from analysis on the level of the individual worker to the level of the organization. For this purpose, Dutton and Thomas (1984) differentiate between the learning curve (which they propose describes learning at the worker level) amd the progress function.

Dutton and Thomas criticise the learning model (in its previous iterations), as it propagates a simplified understanding of learning: the key takeway from that model would be that a big player, with a large production, could make the most progress "along" the learning function, and reduce costs the most; the model would thus promote absorbing as many competitors (and thus production) as possible to maximize learning.
