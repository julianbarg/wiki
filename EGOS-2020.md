## Reaction to [[Greve Palmer and Pozner 2010]]

* Important piece: normalization of misconduct in [[Vaughan 1999]] - related to decision making based on rules or patterns ([[Cyert and March 1963]]).
* Relevant sections: *The cause of accidental misconduct*, *Spread of misconduct in industries, fields, and economies*, and *How Social-Control Agents Create Organizational Misconduct Social-control*.

## Reaction to [[Mohliver 2019]]

* Couldn't this also be a learning story? Demonstrates the fact that learning is not always positive, can also be negative and hinder performance (at least in the long run).
* Using the language of [[social control agents]].

## Reaction to [[Palmer 2008]]
* This could be a valuable source to show that in line with [[BTOF]], rules (or norms) at any level can allow questionable practice to proliferate.
