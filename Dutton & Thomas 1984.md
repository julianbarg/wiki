## One-paragraph summary
The article signifies the move of the literature from analysis on the level of the individual worker to the level of the organization, and moving from the learning curve to studying the mechanisms of learning. For this purpose, Dutton and Thomas (1984) differentiate between the learning curve (which they propose describes learning at the worker level) and the progress function, that they study. Dutton and Thomas criticize the learning curve model (in its previous iterations), as it propagates a simplified understanding of learning: the key takeway from that model would be that a big player, with a large production, could make the most progress "along" the learning function, and reduce costs the most; the model would thus promote absorbing as many competitors (and thus production) as possible to maximize learning. When the market share effect was questioned (Lippman and Rumelt 1982), this also put into doubt the validity of the learning curve. 

"In offering cumulative volume as the only policy input available, they fail to match the complex, underlyng dynamics of firms' costs and imply that building cumulative volume is the only way to achieve progress" (Dutton and Thomas 1984, 236). In particular, Dutton and Thomas (1984) find that a bottom-up understanding of organizational learning could be benefitial: "the path of progress is subject to control, [...] and certain kinds of progress effects can be induced" (Dutton and Thomas 1984, 237). Dutton and Thomas (1984) list a significant number of factors that could explain this progress along the learning curve, for instance, policy that induces local learning, or internal design (e.g., degree of mechanization), or organizational design variables, such as work culture.

Interestingly, Dutton and Thomas already highlighted the importance of regularity for learning: "steep improvement rates have been observed under conditions in which model and design changes (within models) occurred at regular intervals (Conway & Schultz, 1959), as well as when product design was unchanged for long periods of time (Baloff, 1971)." (Dutton and Thomas 1984, 239).
