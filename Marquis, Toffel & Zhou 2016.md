## One-paragraph summary

Constructing a variable on *selective disclosure magnitude*, representing how much a firms disclosure is made up of metrics that *don't matter* to the firms environmental impact. Unfortunately, there is a problem with how this variable is constructed. A firm that discloses all its emissions would have a selective disclosure magnitude of _zero_, but a firm only disclosing one variable out of ten, if that variable made up for 90% of its environmental damages, would have a magnitude of _-0.8_ (0.1 - 0.9), where lower *is supposed to* indicate lower selective disclosure magnitude. How one can have a lower selective disclosure magnitue than an actor that discloses all of its emissions, I don't know.
