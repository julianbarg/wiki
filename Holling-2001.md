## Concepts
* Complexity: "anything we do not understand, because there area apparently a large number of interacting elements" (p. 390f.)
* Hierarchies: not top-down, but semi-autonomous levels that interact and have an ordering. "As long as the transfer from one level to the other
is maintained, the interactions within the levels themselves can be transformed, or the variables changed, without the whole system losing its integrity" (Holling 2001: 392f
