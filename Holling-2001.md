## Concepts
* Complexity: "anything we do not understand, because there area apparently a large number of interacting elements" (p. 390f.)
* Hierarchies: not top-down, but semi-autonomous levels that interact and have an ordering. "As long as the transfer from one level to the other
is maintained, the interactions within the levels themselves can be transformed, or the variables changed, without the whole system losing its integrity" (Holling 2001: 392f

## One-paragraph summary
Holling (2001) introduces the nature of system change and persistence, based on [[Gunderson and Holling 2001]]. 
Systems have three main attributes that determine their development: potential, connectedness, and resilience. *Potential* describes the available resources or "wealth" of the system. *Connectedness* describes in how far the system is internally connected and hence internally controllable. When the system has high potential, but also a high degree of connectedness, it may become overly rigid, and hence very accident-prone (*conservation* period). In this high potential environment, an event such as a forest fire, or a plague can derail the system, and lead to a *release* event. Eventually, a *reorganization* (such as Schumpeter's creative destruction) may occur that spawns valuable innovations and possibly enables a new growth (*exploitation*) phase. In this process, resilience describes the ability of a system to experiment without endangering the integrity of the overall system. High *rigidity*, as present in a high potential-high connectedness situation can diminish a systems resilience. At times though Resilience can sustain a maladaptive system, too. "Functional groups across size classes of organisms maintain ecosystem resilience." (Holling 2001: 403).

Another feature of the systems is that they can interact with each other. Systems exist on different levels and localities, and are nested (lower-level systems are located within higher-level systems). As long as their interactions are not affected, systems can change a fair amount without affecting interrelated systems. But at times, they interact with each other, for instance when a smaller system's revolt affects processes in highly rigid higher-level systems, or when a *remember* process from a higher-level systems reinstates a previous routine or state in a lower-level system.
