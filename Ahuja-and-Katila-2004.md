## One-page summary
Ahuja & Katila (2004) provides empirical evidence on the origin of resources. The authors' interest lies in resource heterogeneity: why are some companies able to develop technological innovations that others are not able to develop? They point to idiosyncratic situations faced by companies as the sources of innovations that represent resources. Hypothesis 1 states that it is technological exhaustion that leads to "greater […] intensity of subsequent search" (Ahuja & Katila 2004: 890), and thus will increase unique search outcomes up to a threshold (Hypothesis 3). Further, expansion and search in other geographic areas with a different context „will trigger changes in its international research presence“ (Ahuja & Katila 2004: 890; Hypethesis 2) and thus will increase unique search outcomes up to a threshold (Hypothesis 4). The paper predicts  an inverted U-shaped curve for both intensity of science search and breadth of geography search (Hypothesis 3 & Hypothesis 4). 

The authors test their hypothesis by evaluating the effect of technology exhaustion on science search (Hypothesis 1; with control variables). Technology exhaustion is a reference to previous innovations in a company’s patents, which indicates reliance on existing knowledge instead of development of new ideas (“remix” instead of creation). Science search is the average number of references to scientific papers in a company’s patents. Hypothesis 2 is tested by regressing the number of markets the company is active in on the diversity of countries where the company files their patents (with control variables). Both hypotheses hold. 

Hypothesis 3 and Hypothesis 4 predict a curvilinear relationship between science search and number of patents, and geography search and number of patents, respectively. The authors run a Poisson regression in which both the regular and squared independent variables are statistically significant, lending support to a U-shaped relationship. They are unable to determine however, whether the relationship for science search is U-shaped or just signifies diminishing returns (no inflection point), because of a lack of observations in the extreme points on the right. It should also be mentioned that the authors include comprehensive control variables (such as time-lagged versions of the independent variables) to protect against autocorrelation and check the robustness of the model. 

Both the hypotheses 1 and 2 as well as hypotheses 3 and 4 raise valuable points. The exhaustion of search opportunities in their own area of expertise may cause companies to turn to nonlocal search, similar to geographic expansion. They may however "overstretch", which may result in diminishing or plunging returns. It is important to note that the models controls for firm size and R&D expenditure of the examined companies. Therefore, the extension of search to more geographic does not go hand in hand with an increase in resources available for search activities. In other words, the same resources are stretched over a greater geographic scale, leadings necessarily to fragmentation and inefficiencies. Therefore, the findings do not suggest that the establishment of a new R&D office in a new location reduces the efficiency of existing R&D offices. In other words, it is not (only) the breadths that leads to an eventual decline of outcomes, as Hypothesis 4 seems to suggest. Ceteris paribus, the opening of a new R&D office of course does not decrease the productiveness of existing R&D offices.
