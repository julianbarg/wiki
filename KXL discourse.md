# KXL discourse

[[_TOC_]]

## Themes

### Outcomes

* Lack of compromises
* Lack of transfer of information
* Derailment of discourse--tangentializing

### Modes of discourse

* Legal
* Language
    * This is what @Leibel2018 covers as rhetorics
* Buraucratic/procedure
* Representation/support
    * E.g., demonstrations that highlight support for a demand
    * Demonstrations can also be interpreted as showing potential number of supporter-activists
    * On the other hand, security and police mobilization show activists what they are up against
    * _Is it_ really that different to gangs having a light clash in _Gangs of New York_ (I don't actually remember the plot of that movie, please don't crucify me)--meaning its _the implications_
* Physical
    * Blockade of DAPL
    * Construction work--creating _fait accompli_
* Meta
    * Talking about the rules/mode of discourse while playing by the rules
* Delegitimizing efforts
    * E.g., calling out somebody's representation/support efforts as artificial
    * Also somewhat meta
* Bluffing
    * Perceived intention matters, and so does bluffing
    * E.g., if company beliefs activists will escalate anyways, they may ignore negotiation requests
    * Also somewhat meta
* Switch-and-bait
    * Letting other participants belief you are engaging in mode A, but it is actually mode B
* "Total" discourse
    * Discourse in several different modes at the same time
    * When stakes are high, parties may go all out and latch onto any options

### Transitions/processes

* _Decisions_!
    * When a lawsuit is settled, or a committee files a decision, discourse often moves to different mode
    * Or when decision comes up
* Rule negotiation (similar to meta)
* Filing a lawsuit/injunctions
* Mobilization of support
    * Especially communication that is director at _supporters_ rather than other parties 
    * Includes astroturfing
* Coordination
    * Allows for companies to take advantage of government procedures for process, potentially same for activists
* Election contributions
* Newspaper ads/placing op-eds/open letters
* Contacting political decision makers
    * Activists might write and call
    * TransCanada facilitated large meetings with politicians in Alberta, same purpose

## Note

@Leibel2018 descriebes two weaknesses of the literatures on _discourse_, _rhetorics_, and _framing_. Interaction is not well explored, and modes of discourse are not covered well. Despite discource, rhetorics, and framing describing processes of interaction, the literature often remains void of "dynamic and local understandings" [@Leibel2018, 158]. In other words, interaction and change of understandings is not commonly explored, outside of shifts to dominant understanding. By modes of discourse, I mean those forms of communication other than written accounts in the dominant channel. Analysis is typically limited to written accounts. Discourse encompasses--but is not limited to--"written documents, verbal reports, artwork, spoken words, pictures, symbols, buildings, and other artifacts" (@Phillips2004, 635 via @Leibel2018, 156).

The literature also has a focus on politics. That is something I probably take for granted, but unfortunately it is not something we can expect to see in the literature on institutions.

The goal of the KXL study is to surface the discourse on environmental impacts--or _absence_ thereof! The preliminary analysis surfaced a multitude of tangents and distractions of the discourse--the systematic compilation and analysis of environmental impacts is the exception or almost absent. @Leibel2018 would suggest that a generous analysis of the field and discourse _should_ enrich the literature. To do so, a study should pay equal or proportional attention to all participants in the discourse. In particular, one should avoid focusing on the viewpoint of one of the parties involved, e.g, as the dominant logic. Similarly, a focus on negotiated understandings may underappreciate diverging viewpoints, if they stand on stark contrast to the dominant "fabric of reality" and cannot be "weaved in".

The task at hand is to achieve an analytical richness, and a better representation of the institutional field--whether this representation can then be boiled down again into a digestible model is a different question. The first ingredient is a sensible set of actors. In the case of KXL, involvement in public forums is a decent selection criteria. The second ingredient _may_ be a variety of sources. I refer again to the list of items provided by @Phillips2004: "written documents, verbal reports, artwork, spoken words, pictures, symbols, buildings, and other artifacts". @Foucault1965 prominently features buildings as both artifacts and evidence of the change in discourse on madness. Similarly, in the case of KXL it is the ground itself that signifies changes. There is first a change of ownership, and surveying work. Environmental damages--albeit rare, since the project never made much progress--signify a change in discourse, and bring about change for discourse. While I may not be able to survey these, and other non-written accounts, they _are_ documented in the far reaches of newspaper archives.

<!--account for the unlinear-->
What we may obtain then is the anatomy of a discoursive conflict. The different actors and sources highlight the different modes of discourse--it is a discourse that played out through many different channels on different levels at the same time, with a fair amount of interaction between channels and levels. The list above shows some of the modes of discourse that stand out the most. A glance on process also reveals mechanisms of transition. The [[Nebraska episode|KXL episodes#nebraska-law-episodes]] showcases that there are many of these moments where discourse changes from one mode to another, and they interact with each other, resulting in the unexpected outcomes of social action that we typically observe [@Giddens1979].

<!--then, anatomize, topografie-->
One concern that has to be raised is the nature of the data I present. The findings are "novel", in the sense that they cannot currently be found in the literature. However, one might say that the findings constitute merely a list, a "dictionary" of the world [cf. @Sutton1995]. The actual "findings" are much more the mode of analysis and model of the process. Hopefully, through the model that I propose--a model based on discourse, communicative action, and institutional fields--the reader will come to understand the surprising duality (or shall I say paradox?) that is the simultaneous presence and absence of dialogue. When we look at the ultimate compilation and synopsis of discourse that is provided by the State Department--the successive environmental impact assessments--we see that more information get included over time. However, there is very little change with regard to the written statements by the opposing parties. Discourse is inherently disfunctional, and the emergence of a negotiated understanding may not involve change of positions by the involved parties. Rather, it can be interpreted as the domination of discourse by one party, in conjunction with ceremonial references to the rhetorics used by the other party. The domination can be reversed just as fast as it came about, exemplarized in my data by the two revisions of the State Department decision by two subsequent administrations respectively.

A note on the nature of conflict or competition in this empirical context. Usually in business we see the conflict of one versus many. Planning can be thrown off because we may not know where the next move comes from, ie., even the very actor who makes the next move is unknown--think creative destruction. There, we think of strategy in terms of _positioning_, because the total number and position of players is unknown. In cases of discourse, the number of participants _can_ be much lower, and maneuvering and analysis of other parties can really pay of. Rather than _strategy_, one might think of it as _tactics_--the maneuvering of an agent within an overseeable terrain, where strategy is the larger scope of providing resources to multiple _theaters_ of conflict ahead of the specific engagement (e.g., TransCanada's decision to enter the pipeline business).

## Notes

* What about robust action in this context? Garbage can also?
* Is polarization an issue? Is it an issue how much is perceived to be at stake?
