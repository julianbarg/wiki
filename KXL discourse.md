# KXL discourse

[[_TOC_]]

## Themes

### Outcomes

* Lack of compromises
* Lack of transfer of information
* Derailment of discourse--tangentializing

### Modes of discourse

* Legal
* Language
    * This is what @Leibel2018 covers as rhetorics
* Buraucratic/procedure
* Representation/support
    * E.g., demonstrations that highlight support for a demand
    * Demonstrations can also be interpreted as showing potential number of supporter-activists
    * On the other hand, security and police mobilization show activists what they are up against
    * _Is it_ really that different to gangs having a light clash in _Gangs of New York_ (I don't actually remember the plot of that movie, please don't crucify me)--meaning its _the implications_
* Physical
    * Blockade of DAPL
    * Construction work--creating _fait accompli_
* Meta
    * Talking about the rules/mode of discourse while playing by the rules
* Delegitimizing efforts
    * E.g., calling out somebody's representation/support efforts as artificial
    * Also somewhat meta
* Bluffing
    * Perceived intention matters, and so does bluffing
    * E.g., if company beliefs activists will escalate anyways, they may ignore negotiation requests
    * Also somewhat meta
* Switch-and-bait
    * Letting other participants belief you are engaging in mode A, but it is actually mode B
* "Total" discourse
    * Discourse in several different modes at the same time
    * When stakes are high, parties may go all out and latch onto any options

### Transitions/processes

* Rule negotiation (similar to meta)
* Filing a lawsuit/injunctions
* Mobilization of support
    * Especially communication that is director at _supporters_ rather than other parties 
    * Includes astroturfing
* Coordination
    * Allows for companies to take advantage of government procedures for process, potentially same for activists
* Election contributions
* Newspaper ads/placing op-eds/open letters
* Contacting political decision makers
    * Activists might write and call
    * TransCanada facilitated large meetings with politicians in Alberta, same purpose

## Description

Usually, in business we see the conflict of one vs. many. Planning can be thrown off because we may not know where the next move comes from, ie., even the very actor who makes the next move is unknown--think creative destruction. There, we think of strategy in terms of _positioning_, because the total number and position of players is unknown. In cases of discourse, the number of participants is often much lower, and maneuvering and analysis of other parties can really pay of.
