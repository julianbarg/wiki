## Important points

## One-paragraph summary

Pinto, Leana and Pil (2008) establish that there are two important dimensions to corporate misconduct: (1) the primary beneficiary and (2) colluders (within the organization). Along these two dimensions, there are two important types of organizations: (1) organizations of corrupt individuals (OCI), and (2) corrupt organizations (CO). OCIs are defined on a continuous scale (more or less corrupt members), whereas COs are discrete: an organization is a CO, when it has been found by a [[social control agent]] to be one.
