## One-paragraph summary

The authors are concerned that org theorists subordinate narrative construction to analysis, value the ontology of history while neglecting the implications of historical epistemology. The authors hold that as an alternative to the ontological view, "it could be said that 'history matters' epistemologically for understanding how the past can be known or represented" (p. 252). The authors also associate an emphasis on readily available narrative themselves ("singular events [as] stepping-stones toward the development of generalizable theories", p. 253), with an overt shirt from structure to agency, with "great man" theory (pp. 252f). Further, capturing the past in the structure of a narrative means imposing that narrative on the history, which does not have a structure by itself.

## Important points
* Challenging the notion that interview data is more reliable than archival data (p.255). The researcher should be cautious, regardless whether dealing with interviews or archival data.
* "Historians therefore have a strong prefreence for 'nonintentional evidence,' by which they mean 'anything remaining from the past that was not made with the intention of revealing the past to us, but simply emerged as part of normal life'" (pp. 256f).
