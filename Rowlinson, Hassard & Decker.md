## One-paragraph summary

The authors are concerned that org theorists subordinate narrative construction to analysis, value the ontology of history while neglecting the implications of historical epistemology. The authors hold that as an alternative to the ontological view, "it could be said that 'history matters' epistemologically for understanding how the past can be known or represented" (p. 252).
