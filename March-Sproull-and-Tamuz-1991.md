Organizational learning happens based on experience. How do organizations learn when there are few events? March et al (1991) explore how organizations learn from infrequent events, as they are hard to interpret. It is a complex organizational process to interpret infrequent events correctly and finding agreements on their interpretations. Military organization that is not at war can find it hard to learn. Similarly, it is hard for an airline firm to learn, which has rarely experienced fatal accidents. 

The authors provide examples how learning can happen based on the experience of the decision making process itself, even without considering the outcome. This can happen if the outcome feedback is slower or unclear. Organizations treat rare histories as stories rather than single data points. If a history is identified as a critical event, it is studied extensively. Criticalness of an event depends on its place in the history, whether the event was consequential or not. Criticalness of an event also depends on the “beliefs” of about that event. Metaphorical power of an event also contributes to the criticalness of an event. 

Another way organizations “augment” single history is by attempting multiple interpretations.  Often times liabilities are shared by the members of an organization; multiple interpretations and a consensus around those interpretations facilitates the learning process. 

Near-histories and hypothetical histories are simulated experiences to learn from. Near-histories that are not real accidents but are near accidents can bring in more perspectives and help to learn. But in case of a near-history it is not easy to decide where the learning should be emphasized on – the threat or irrelevance. 

Authors argue that reliability and validity are hard to balance. Reliability indicates the common understanding of the events and validity indicates understanding the predictability of the single histories. Due to lack of cumulative knowledge about single event there is ambiguity and multiple interpretations. Responses and interpretations of critical events tend to be based on “temporal proximity, cognitive availability or political convenience” rather than on objective measures. Organizational processes such as meetings facilitate the process of shared understanding. Lack of multiple events and measurement error coupled with model misspecification can result in invalid inferences from single histories. Exploring histories richly, adding multiple observers and thinking about near-histories can alleviate some of the concerns with regards to validity of learning.

Overall, this article focuses on the complex processes of learning from infrequent events. The authors argue that there is always a trade off between reliability and validity when learning from historical experiences. The article finishes with four important questions on historical inference.
