### Note on Suddaby

Suddaby notes the commonly heroic or "hypermascular" nature of institutional entrepreneurs. That is because legitimacy-as-a-process studies often focus on one side of the discourse. For instance, @Maguire2009 focus mostly on the translation process, while attention to theorization by Carlson, and interactive processes, is relatively flat. That might be an opportunity for me because the point I am trying to make is exactly that deinstitutionalization is an interactive process with multiple paticipants--a messy process!

## One-paragraph summary
[[Meyer & Rowan 1977]] as well as [[DiMaggio & Powell 1983]] opened this discourse by putting into question the presumption of efficient bureaucracy and exploring the antecedents of bureaucratization. At its core, Institutional Theory studies how at times choices on firm characteristics are determined by the environment (structure), e.g. peers' characteristics, rather than (agentic) efficiency concerns. At different times, authors took different approaches to balancing agency and structure. [[DiMaggio and Powell 1983]] for instance hold that rational actors consciously succumb to the isomorphic pressure to gain certain benefits, whereas [[Oliver 1991]] explains that actors can, when they are aware of institutional pressure, use various strategies to defy this pressure.

## One-page summary
What determines how organizations are organized (and, subsequently, act)? For the longest time, management literature considered organizational choices to be a result of efficiency concerns, before that notion was called into question ([[Meyer and Rowan 1977]]). Today, the consensus is that institutional forces greatly constrain organizational choices. These institutional forces are (1) *regulative*, (2) *normative*, or (3) *cultural* in nature ([[Scott and Davis 2007]]: 258). For instance, (1) the law necessitates certain organizational features, such as the formal appointment of a CEO, and the existence of an accounting department. Further, (2) social norms guide the behavior of individuals within organizations; professionals for example undergo professional training and carry very salient norms of professional work procedure into their organizations. Finally, (3) when looking for solutions for challenges, managers generate these answers based on their experience (as do all humans). Experience and knowledge guides cognitive processes in individuals, thus, any solution that a manager comes up with, even a novel one, will be relative to (e.g., a remix, or a negation) existing concepts. The most common place to look for models to emulate is the competitive environment, hence the popular notion of institutional isomorphism within industries ([[Scott and Davis 2007]]).

The early literature emphasized the constraints that institutional processes impose on organizations. [[DiMaggio and Powell (1983)|DiMaggio and Powell 1983]] explicitly set out to study why it is that organizational forms and practices are so homogeneous. Over time, the literature has placed a greater emphasis on opportunities that present themselves for managers to actively navigate the institutional environment. [[Oliver (1991)|Oliver 1991]] for instance describes the tactics that organizations have at their disposal to react to institutional processes. These responses are on a spectrum from compliance to non-compliance. Further, Oliver emphasizes that even in the case of formal compliance with institutional norms, organizations have considerable leeway to diverge.-->
