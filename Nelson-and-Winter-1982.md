## One-paragraph summary
If you did not learn anything from this book, at least you should remember that Nelson and Winter theorize about path dependence and change, anchored in operating characteristics (routines), "genes", and routine-changing processes. Whereas neoclassical economic theory assumes that firms blindly optimize profits, Nelson and Winter assume that firms have deeply ingrained individual interests that they pursue, and have limited capabilities to adjust their trajectory (routine-changing processes).

## One-page summary
In Chapter 1 and 2, the authors provide a summary and a critique of orthodox theory (neoclassical economic theory) to demonstrate why an evolutionary theory is needed. Orthodox theory considers the firm to be a production function, based on two assumptions: firms’ profit maximizing behavior and the existence of equilibria. The combination of the two assumptions suggest that firms behave rationally to maximize profits (or revenue), and such rational behavior ultimately leads to a market equilibrium.

Evolutionary theory on the other hand borrows from biological ideas, in particular with regards to selection and adaptation to a competitive environment. According to evolutionary theory, firms do not necessarily optimize to survive in the competitive environment. Rather, firms are construed as having certain capabilities and decision rules, which are reflected by routines. These routines can be divided into three types: operating characteristics, “genes”, and routine-changing processes. Operating characteristics refer to the automatic adherence to routines, which is activated under stable conditions. To use the analogy to pilots, it corresponds to the auto-flight mode. The “genes” are the result of selection processes, in which the successful firms’ routines prevail over unsuccessful firms'. The routine-changing processes are the metaroutines, discussed by Knott (2001), which are modifications of routines over time, involving “search” activities. This corresponds to the pilot tweaking the auto-flight mode to adjust to changing environments. 

By theorizing these routines, especially the routine-changing processes, evolutionary theory is able to explain organizational learning. Orthodox theory omits operational learning, as it assumes that adjustments to market changes are instantaneous, although it acknowledges some limitations, such as adjustment costs. Hence, orthodox theory is unable to explain how companies operate in competitive environments, and remains a “static” theory. 

There have been attempts in orthodox economics to incorporate innovation and technical change. For example, Schumpeter argued that growth is the result of innovation. Innovation leads to the devaiation from routines, and upsets the equilibrium. Innovation continuously destroys existing equilibria and creates new ones from within, similar to mutantion in biology. Nonetheless, economic theories to explain innovation and technical change have been developing separately from the mainstream economics that sill focus on the static nature. Evolutionary theory intends to reconcile these two different economic phenomena by relaxing assumptions that orthodox theory has made. Firms are not uniformly maximizing profits, as firms may have different motivations. Moreover, firms are not uniformly converging towards equilibria once and for all as firms have different capabilities, and develop different strategies. 

The authors show major departures from several school of thoughts, including classical, Marxist, and neoclassical economists. However, the authors sympathize with the intuition of these school of thoughts, what the authors termed as appreciative theory. The authors argue that in the process of building a formal theory on top of the appreciate theory, the elaborate mathematical tools that layered assumptions upon assumption, have lost their way. In other words, the authors see a significant disconnect between the formal and appreciative theorizing in orthodox economic theorizing. 

In Chapter 9, the authors try to develop a formal model of evolutionary theory through simulation based on ground rules: first, the firm’s decision rule is to use all of its capacity to produce output, using its current technique; second, the Schumpeterian competition of changes in industry states is recreated through probabilistic transition rules; third, similar to behavioral theorists, firms engage in local search and imitation due to their bounded rationality and tendency to satisfice; fourth, when an alternative comes up, firms adopt the alternative only if it yields higher return, but make random errors. As a whole the model is a Markovian process with constant and time-dependent transition probabilities. The initial conditions are calibrated so that it resembles Solow’s data for 1909. The simulation model succeeds in showing a similar growth pattern to that of Solow growth model, as well as its special case of the Cobb-Douglas production function.  

It is remarkable that even with the relaxation of orthodox theory’s assumptions, the simulation proves to be as accurate as orthodox theory in explaining economic growth. This paper makes contributions in relation to previous theories in strategy. First, in relation to RBV, this paper further opens up the dialogue on why firms exhibit heterogeneous resources. As firms engage in local search, they continue to hone their existing capabilities, which may result in the absence of convergence to “best practices,” or a market equilibrium. Second, in relation to TCE, this paper can explain how firms may change their organizational structures against the backdrop of changing environments. One of the major criticism of TCE was that it holds the environment constant, and hence, does not address the adaptation of firms. However, this paper can complement the lacking explanation through employing the concept of “metaroutines,” where firms actively adapt to the changing environment. Therefore, this paper incorporates both the static and dynamic phenomena of the economy, and bridges the formal and appreciative theories.
