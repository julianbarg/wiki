## One-sentence summary
Demonstrates the tension between targeting a broader segment and achieving fit (legitimacy) in all targeted niches. The empirical test uses the movie industry. The author demonstrates that in this industry, targeting more genres leads to more attention (reviews) from the audience (critics; H1), but the fit is worse and as a result the reviews are lower on average (H2).

## One-page summary
Do organizations’ performance depend on the characteristics of their niche? This is suggested by the principal of allocation. Hsu (2006) showcases in a largely convincing empirical analysis of the movie industry on the one hand that ecology has a major influence on performance, but on the other hand that actors can invest organizational resources to mediate the effect of lack of fit. Thereby, the analysis offers a novel way to connect ecology and legitimacy literature. The analysis offered in this article is limited to the relatively specific context of the movie industry. 

Hsu (2006) draws up the development and market entry of movies (single-project organization) in multiple stages. First, the movie is developed and presented to studios, allowing the movie makers to consider the genre and potential fit with a niche. This stage allows movie makers to consciously choose a preferred value proposition in the hopes that it may find a niche. This initial value proposition can be amended in the second stage, when the marketing strategy is derived. This stage allows the organization to choose their target niche or niches. They may choose to target several niches, which increases the potential target audience **(H1)**, but doing so might risk the appeal to the specific sub-audiences **(H2)**. Spanning more niches will lead to less consensus about an organization’s fit **(H3)** “with targeted taste positions” (ibid. 426), while this fit in general increases the size of an audience the organization can attract **(H4)**. But even if the organization spans multiple niches (1.17 to 2.33 on average), it is still possible to establish more consensus in the audience, which mediates the effect of niche width on appeal described in hypothesis one **(H5)**. While all arguments made are conclusive, the article (and the movie single-project organization literature in general) lacks a micro perspective on what makes a good movie. This lack of control variables makes it appear as if genre spanning and genre fit with the audience are the only measures of movie quality. 

Overall, Hsu (2006) manages to confirm many of the postulates from the previous literature to hold true for the movie industry, while inserting propositions from contingency theory. In the movie industry, an organization’s success depends on its ability to capitalize on a variety of niches, but also on its success in sufficiently meeting each individual niche’s expectation. In summary, Hsu (2006) delivers convincing empirical evidence for an ecological theory’s potential to offer an accurate reflections of legitimation processes.
