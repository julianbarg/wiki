# @Heikkurinen2019

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]], [[Constructivism & Ecology]]_

## One-paragraph summary

@Heikkurinen2019 attempt to integrate the sustainability discourse with insights on agency, in particular leaning on ideas of Bruno Latour. They argue that agency should be taken serious and advocate for both a "horizontal" and "vertical" model. Horizontal in the sense that every actor--including non-human actors such as organizations--should be taken serious as an independent unit. Vertical in the sense that with the coming of the anthropocene, the vertical dependence of all actors on earth should be acknowledged. The first part of the article is a very valuable introduction of the literature on the anthropocene, and on Latour's thoughts on agency and actors. In the second part, the authors outline implications for action and responsiblity. In short: organizations should take action and be held responsible. Unfortunately, these sections fall back on normative ideas, meaning while the implementation would be laudable, there is not much in terms of mechanisms that would lead us to believe that this wishfull thinking will ever be implemented.
