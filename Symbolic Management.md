[[Westphal & Park 2020]]        | SM is manipulating overseers into believing that you meet expectations, to appear legitimate.
[[Durand, Hawn & Ioannou 2019]] | Firms (may) decide for SM based on their willingness *and* ability. They consider issue saliance, organizational resources etc.
[[Schnackenberg et al 2019]]    | SM is the identification and management of symbols by organizations, including creation, elaboration, and association.
[[Cuypers, Koh & Wang 2016]]    | Not just the sum of philantrophic giving, the method also matters to the audience.
[[Fiss & Zajac 2004]]           | German firms adopt shareholder orientation based on interestst of their stakeholders, e.g., banks, governments, families.
[[Westphal & Zajac 1998]]       | The stock market reacts positively to LTIP language, regardless of whether it is implemented.
