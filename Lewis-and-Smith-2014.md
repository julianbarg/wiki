## One-paragraph summary
Review of paradox as a metatheory. Paradox informs a lot of research, and allows for analyzing phenomena, but it also provides a new perspective on theorizing. Businesses often face dualisms, such as short-term versus long-term, exploration versus exploitation, etc. Contingency theory famously seeks for criteria that favor one approach over the other. However, when the tension to be addressed is enduring, paradox calls for a holistic and dynamic rethinking, to clear the way for synergistic solutions. The paradox insight on exploration and exploitation tension for instance is that this tension will not be resolved, rather, a dynamic management style should be found that incorporates both these contradictory approaches.
