_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

Open with openening quote from @Purser1995. Make the point that not much has changed. Their main point is the push for a research on relationships. My main point is that we have not moved much since then, and we are still asking for research on relationships today. The main reason being that it is somehow a taboo to talk about the phenomenon of emissions e.g., from coal power plants, stripped of theory (although sociologists somehow find ways to talk about that and still be grounded in theory). Instead we have to dress stuff in theory and go to the level of organizations again and again. Sometimes the industry is the determining factor!
