## One-paragraph summary
The authors bring forward some resilience literature, but by and large, this literature is still underdeveloped. The authors present some literature that hints at differences on the *individual* level in terms of resilience, and the ability of employees to offset some of the impact of disasters through extra efforts. At the organizational level, the authors wonder about the role of *horizontal vs. vertical coordination*. In a similar vein, *network* can be used to analyze resilience: redundant connections in a network can act as substitutes when the primary connection fails. *Tri-sector collaboration* describes the collaboration between the private and public sector, and society. All three actors are critical to disaster recovery, but they have diverging interests and responses to disasters. How can their collaboration be facilitated?
