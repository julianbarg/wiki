## One-paragraph summary
How do firms adapt? Vergne and Depeyre (2016) argue that a firm might either rely on attention (anticipative adaption), or asset reconfiguration to adapt to a changing environment. Attention refers to the cognition literature, which assumes that managers' observation of the firm's environment determines subsequent action, whereas asset recofiguration borrows from the [[dynamic capabilities]] literature.

## One-page summary
This paper explains how both managerial attention and asset reconfiguration (dynamic capabilities) advance firms’ adaptation. In the prior literature of firm adaptation, attention and dynamic capabilities have been discussed by scholars separately. However, this paper argues that we need to understand both factors to understand how firms adapt to their changing environment. While scholars in both camps have recognized the importance of “the other” factor (i.e., capabilities for attention scholars and attention for capabilities scholars; see Kaplan 2008 for a detailed review), there were few empirical studies that look at the relationship between attention, reconfiguration, and adaptation.  

Empirically, the paper explores the influence of managerial attention (i.e., the key construct in cognition research) and asset reconfiguration (i.e., the observable outcome of using capabilities) on 17 U.S. defense firms’ adaptation to a shift in their industry, as crystallized by 9/11. The dependent variable of this study is a survey-based measure of adaptation (experts of the defense field) that does not rely on performance indicators. First independent variable is managerial attention, which is measured by two different constructs: attention timing and attention intensity. The second independent variable is asset reconfiguration, which is measured by two different constructs as well: reconfiguration scope and reconfiguration intensity. The level of resource dependence is controlled for.

The analysis on data shows that there are four different patterns of adaptation: First, anticipative firms (C1) are the only adapters to exhibit both intense and early attention to shifting conditions, and to not systematically increase their reconfiguration scope after 9/11. Secondly, responsive adapters (C2) are defense focused firms that waited until 2002 to significantly reconfigure their assets, at which time they radically overhauled the structure of their business operations by redistributing many assets across SBUs (e.g., it was not until 2003 that LOC drew from existing SBUs to build a new SBU focused on networked solutions). Finally, both opportunistic (C3) and decisive adapters (C4), which are more diversified into civilian activities, were late in paying attention to the environmental shift in the defense sector, and opted for a wait-and see approach to reconfiguration of their assets. 

To conclude, the models in the paper analyze the main variables examined by the two primary theoretical perspectives on adaptation—cognition and capabilities—and suggest that neither dynamic capabilities nor superior cognition must be present for firms to adapt.
