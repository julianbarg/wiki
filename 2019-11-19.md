## Observations/postulates (that define what I care about)
* The outcome variable has a grounding in the physical world (as opposed to any index/rating/score).
* We have a relatively clear sense of what is desirable - less pipeline spills!
* There are two pathways toward improvement - learning or modernization (technology). The right "solution" is not obvious.
* Somewhat preliminary observation: No operator is "clean" or in other words has a perfect operating performance. *Tangent*: The industry can never never be clean.
* The goal of less spills diverges from the overarching organization - hence why there are no organizations with a perfect operating performance.

**Use of these theories would naturally follow from these postulates**:

* [[Learning]]
* [[BTOF]] (specifically politics)

**Literatures/concepts I have looked into** (reg. locating my research):

* [[Attention-based view]]
* [[Learning|Organizational learning]]
* [[Organizational forgetting]]
* [[Vicarious learning]]
* [[Search]] (less so; based on Huber 1991 and Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011)
* [[Sensemaking]]

## Questions
Literature has moved on from [[learning]] to sensemaking/attention?

* Learning following the original, engineering-inspired literature.
* The other taking the mechanisms behind learning much more serious, in a sociology-inspired literature.

-----

## Opportunities
* Learning in organizations with diverging goals is not really discussed yet.

-----

## Plan

Place paper within learning literature.

Model accident rates as well as possible.

Show the learning curve.

**Then** include the change in strategy/development as external shock.

What **is** the learning literature though?!
