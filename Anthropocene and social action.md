# Anthropocene: technical and social dimension

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

* We have entered the anthropocene.
* Stilized story based on @Lewis2015, @Reyers2018, @Davies2016, @Ergene2020, @Sterner2019, @Heikkurinen2019, @Wright2018, @Palsson2013.
    * This literature will be the first Eisenhardt table after proposal (see ToDo below).
* Technical and social dimensions are being collapsed into one.
* Previously, human decisions could be either superseeded by environmental processes, or consequences--on a supraregional scale--could be sidestepped. Social and ecological systems were intertwined, but an invalid understanding of social-ecological systems could be quickly "patched up" or "glossed over" with another invalid understanding.
    * This is a framing of the literature that will later help us get to our model (validity), foreshadows our approach.
* Now--that is the core argument of the anthropocene literature--consequences are becoming too severe to ignore [@Sterner2019].
    * Might grab some eyebrow raising examples like wild fires in NA and Europe, droughts in Africa, California [@AghaKouchak2015] and South Asia. Or maybe mass extinction events such as the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event [@Conroy2019], dwindling insect bio mass [@Hallmann2017], or reduction in biodiversity.
        * This might be another (short) literature table to make.
    * On the other hand, many communities can still very much manage to ignore even severe local climate impacts [@Boudet2020]. Mentioning this might be good forshadowing?
* Is there something with coupling already going on here? Previously, environmental issues were easy to decouple, now it is getting more difficult.
* We should/could also note that the technical core of the Anthropocene simply denotes a geological epoch that is dominated by humans [@Lewis2015]. E.g., 1945 nuclear weapon detonations are one proposed start date.

## Anthropocene: technical dimension

* The anthropocene as a technical problem
    * Draw on IPCC reports
        * Note that the IPCC also goes deeper and deeper into the social dimension as time passes
        * This might be another opportunity to create a table to get a good grasp of the literature, on IPCC over time and what they draw on

## ToDo--after proposal

* Table Anthropocene intros/overviews/reviews
* Table on empirical demonstrations of what the Anthropocene is.
* Table on IPCC/related technical literature over time
