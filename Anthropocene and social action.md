# Anthropocene and social action

[[_TOC_]]

* We have entered the anthropocene.
    * Stilized story based on @Lewis2015, @Reyers2018, @Davies2016, @Ergene2020, @Sterner2019, @Heikkurinen2019, @Wright2018, @Palsson2013.
        * This literature will be the first Eisenhardt table.
    * Technical and social dimensions are being collapsed into one.
        * Previously, human decisions could be either superseeded by environmental processes, or consequences--on a supraregional scale--could be sidestepped. Social and ecological systems were intertwined, but an invalid understanding of social-ecological systems could be quickly "patched up" or "glossed over" with another invalid understanding.
            * This is a framing of the literature that will help us get to our model.
        * Now, that is the core argument of the anthropocene literature, were facing a situation where consequences are becoming too severe to ignore [@Sterner2019].
            * Might grab some eyebrow raising examples like wild fires in NA and Europe, droughts in Africa, California [@AghaKouchak2015] and South Asia. Or maybe mass extinction events such as the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event [@Conroy2019], dwindling insect bio mass [@Hallmann2017], or reduction in biodiversity.
            * we should also note that the technical core of the Anthropocene simply denotes a geological epoch that is dominated by humans [@Lewis2015]. E.g., 1945 nuclear weapon detonations are one proposed start date.
            * Could we describe this as loose coupling?
            * On the other hand, many communities can still very much manage to ignore even severe local climate impacts . Good forshadowing?
