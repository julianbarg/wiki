# Anthropocene: technical and social dimension

[[_TOC_]]

> People of Earth, your attention please [...]. As you will no doubt be aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. [...] There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss about it now. [...] What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout.

## Introduction

* We have entered the anthropocene.
* Stilized story based on @Lewis2015, @Reyers2018, @Davies2016, @Ergene2020, @Sterner2019, @Heikkurinen2019, @Wright2018, @Palsson2013.
    * This literature will be the first Eisenhardt table after proposal (see ToDo below).
* Note that the Anthropocene is sometimes associated with climate change, but involves much more than that: global pollution (e.g., microplastics), global ecosystems changes such as the sixth mass extinction event [@Barnosky2011], and other geophysical events of global scale such as the industrial revolution in general and nuclear weapons testing [@Lewis2015].
* Technical and social dimensions are being collapsed into one.
* Previously, human decisions could be either superseeded by environmental processes, or consequences--on a supraregional scale--could be sidestepped. Social and ecological systems were intertwined, but an invalid understanding of social-ecological systems could be quickly "patched up" or "glossed over" with another invalid understanding.
    * This is a framing of the literature that will later help us get to our model (validity), foreshadows our approach.
    * I don't really have any literature of this, this is more generally my application of OT decision making literature to this context. I am sure you could help with this.
* Now--that is the core argument of the anthropocene literature--consequences are becoming too severe to ignore [@Sterner2019].
    * Might grab some eyebrow raising examples like wild fires in NA and Europe, droughts in Africa, California [@AghaKouchak2015] and South Asia. Or maybe mass extinction events such as the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event [@Conroy2019], dwindling insect bio mass [@Hallmann2017], or reduction in biodiversity.
        * This might be another (short) literature table to make.
        * Might want to have one example reladed to climate change, where the physics/mechanisms are relatively clear, and one related to an underresearched topic. Ocean pollution might be a good one, oil spills would keep it topical.
    * On the other hand, many communities can still very much manage to ignore even severe local climate impacts [@Boudet2020]. Mentioning this might be good forshadowing?
* Is there something with coupling already going on here? Previously, environmental issues were easy to decouple, now it is getting more difficult.
    * "World scientists' warning to humanity" [@Cavicchioli2019; @Ripple2017].
    * There is the trend of climate scientists turning activist, see James Hansen.
* We should/could also note that the technical core of the Anthropocene simply denotes a geological epoch that is dominated by humans [@Lewis2015]. E.g., 1945 nuclear weapon detonations are one proposed start date.

## Technical dimension of the Anthropocene (lower right quadrant)

* The anthropocene as a technical problem.
    * Draw on IPCC reports.
        * Note that the IPCC also goes deeper and deeper into the social dimension as time passes.
        * This might be another opportunity to create a table to get a good grasp of the literature, on IPCC over time and what they draw on. 
* Generalize to: the generation of knowledge as an issue of validity.
    * Make clear that this section covers the phenomenon of scientists creating knowledge in a lab or other setting.
    * The quality of the knowledge generation is measured by its our ability to predict outcomes, such as how much an object heats up when it lies in the sun for an hour, or the change of climate after carbon concentration in the atmosphere reaches 350 parts per million.
    * Briefly refer to the mangle of practice and material agency [@Pickering1995].
    * Our knowledge of the atmospheric system of the earth is pretty good.
        * Go into history of climate science [@Forster2017; @Edwards2011].
        * Go into Exxon knowledge on climate change in the 1980s, partially as an example with good sources, partially as foreshadowing [@Supran2017; @Barron2020].
    * We need to emphasize that this is an idealized image of technical knowledge. Modeling our atmospheric system is a relatively trivial problem. 
        * But we already have much less knowledge available when we move e.g., to biotoxicity in general [cf. @Hardy2020]. 
        * Then we go to oil spills, to be topical again. There are some great illustrative examples available in the literature, this will be another table [@Barron2020; @Bruederle2019; @Beyer2016].
        * As a response--not to oil spills but to sciencific community's realization of our lack of knowledge--UN adopted the Precautionary Principle in the 1992 Rio Declaration (which it can be argued is not in effect).
            * "In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation" (Rio Declaration, 1992).
            * We can use this first as an illustration of our general lack of knowledge--the unwillingness of the scientific advisory council to say that we have enough certainty in the food/ecologic safety system to keep operating as we do.
            * Also, more specifically as an example of _policy-practice decoupling_ in the next section, because the principle is effectively not in effect, except for a select few substances. 
                * @Hardy2020 demonstrates this well--invoking the cautionary principle still requires political efforts (of course, we would say).
    * In my previous draft version, there was also a note here about gaps between "established" available valid knowledge, and "common sense" reliable knowledge. For the flow of this, I am not sure it is still necessary, but it could still be brought in and could be made topical [e.g., @Attari2010; @Camilleri2019].
* Now to the problem which entails the transition to the next section. We have an idealized example. Our knowledge of the atmospheric system of the earth is pretty good. Now what do we do with that knowledge?
    * Briefly lay out the scientific continuation to the story. We have certainty about the geophysical mechanisms. Existing infrastructure, operation of already drilled wells, exploration of oil fields continues, and so we can model future emissions relatively well [@McGlade2015; @Tong2019a; @Welsby2021].
    * This is just a side note, but there is something about control here. In theory we can control the climate and pollution issues relatively well--we just don't have control of the variables we need to take the control, because they are social in nature. Something about the language of validity--prediction and control--and reliability also being a necessary condition, as we have talked about before.
    * This is a transition to the next section on the top-right, where we attempt to improve the reliability of our knowledge by engaging the global community.

## Attempting a political solution: regulatory learning

* The idealized understanding of how our world operates: the powerful of the world come together to agree on a solution for a predefined problem.
    * "Predefined" referring to the IPCC reports that are prepared in advance for the UN Climate Change Conferences.
    * The planet is "saved" as the UN "decides" to limit global warning to 1.5ºC (sorry Lee, I know you don't like unnecessary quotation marks, but I couldn't help myself).
* Well, that commitment has very tangible implications, given what we have just heard about climate change being relatively easy to model.
    * There are "incredibly tight constraints for present international climate targets, even if no new emitting infrastructure is ever built" [...]. [W]e would have a reasonable chance of achieving the 1.5 °C target with, first, a global prohibition of all new CO2-emitting devices (including many or most of the already-proposed fossil-fuel-burning power plants); and second, substantial reductions in the historical lifetimes and/or utilization rates of existing industry and electricity infrastructure" [@Tong2019a].
    * "By 2050, we find that nearly 60 per cent of oil and fossil methane gas, and 90 per cent of coal must remain unextracted to keep within a 1.5 °C carbon budget" [@Welsby2021].
    * The necessary emission reductions imply some tough questions that would need to be posed about countries shutting down power plants.
    * Compare that to the character of the Paris agreement.
        * The idea of a binding climate agreement has failed. 

## ToDo--after proposal

* Table Anthropocene intros/overviews/reviews.
* Table on empirical demonstrations of what the Anthropocene is.
* Table on IPCC/related technical literature over time.
* Understanding of climate change over time [@Forster2017; @Edwards2011; @Supran2017; @Barron2020].
* Brief table on oil spills.
