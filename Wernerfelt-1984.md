## One-page summary
Wernerfelt focuses on the resource endowments to answer questions related to the diversification of firms. Some of the questions include, “on which of the firm’s current resources should diversification be based?” and “which resources should be developed through diversification?”  Using a simple mathematical model based on the resource-product matrix (Figure 1.), Wernerfelt illustrates an example of diversification in the case of sequential entry. 

In the paper, resource is defined as assets which are tied semipermanently to the firm, such as brand names, knowledge of technology, killed personnel, trade contacts, etc. Resources lead to high returns over a longer period of time when:  

1. Resources are not subject to unequal bargaining positions between suppliers and buyers or not subject to substitute resources; a monopolistic supplier or a monopsonistic market both reduce the returns of resources. 

2. There are strong entry and resource position barriers; entry barrier refers to preventing potential competitors entering the same market, while resource position barrier refers to preventing competitors from using the same resources. Both barriers are needed to exploit opportunities from the resources. 

3. Resources are attractive; generally, this is relevant to resource position barriers. For example, machine capacity, customer loyalty, production experience, technological leads; 

4. Mergers and acquisitions provide new opportunities, which can provide supplementary and complementary resources. 

The contribution of this paper is that it shifts the attention to resources from products, supplying new concepts, such as resource position barriers as opposed to the traditional entry barrier. Also, by shifting focus to the internal workings, it gives more focus on firms and their production activities by discussing resource management. Further, the paper has practical implications for firms in developing their diversification strategies.

### Discussions on Limitations and Future Research 
Although the paper adds an interesting concept of resource position barrier, it offers little guideline on how to identify or develop resource position barrier. Thus, future research may investigate how firms can identify resource position barrier, or in what ways firms may develop resource position barrier if there were initially none. Another way to extend this paper is to investigate the results of strong resource position barrier sustained over a long period of time. As the author has stated in this paper, resource and product are two sides of the same coin. Then, does a strong resource position barrier in the long run equate a strong monopoly? If not, how are the results of the two different from each other?
