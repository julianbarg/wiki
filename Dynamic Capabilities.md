Both the [[Resource-based View]] and Dynamic Capabilities are independent theories. To make an explicit connection between them is still important: Dynamic Capabilities set out to solve a problem that RBV first explored, and as a result developed some overlapping, and some distinct assumptions and

## One-paragraph summary
RBV holds that companies can own resources (not products) that allow them to build sustained competitive advantages in industries (Barney 1991). The related dynamic capabilities research stream emphasizes the importance of firms reconfiguring their resources to adapt to a changing environment and maintain a competitive advantage. To do so, the firm reconfigures available skill, resources and competences. The firm does so "dynamically", responding to changes in the external environment ([[Teece Pisano and Shuen 1997]]: 515). To empirically test the dynamic capabilities hypothesis, researchers attempted to take a stock of a firms resources, and some capabilities necessary for innovative recombination. Then, the authors test the interaction effect of those two variables on a performance measure. The rational of this testing method is that dynamic capabilities allow for innovative reconfiguration of skills, resources and competences, but a sufficient resource stock is also necessary for this to be effective (Newbert 2007).
