* Good sample size!
* I would assume that serial entrepreneurs simply hire the best people available--how many applicants are there usually anyways? Or do they typically hire through their network?
* I recommend you specify "specific human capital" to refer to the overarching industry (where the synergy takes place) rather than the specific industry. E.g., if one venture is in footwear, and the other in apparel, I would see how expertise in textile is useful, for both, but I cannot see how expertise in footwear would be more important with synergy than without the existence of a potential synergy.
* What about an inversion of causality. "All serial entrepreneurs try to hire candidates with the highest industry experience possible, but portfolio entrepreneurs have the necessary prestige to be able to do so 'because they know what they are doing'". Or maybe that group happens to have more experience and thus a larger network to hire from?
* The major point is - I just don't believe that it isn't just everybody just hiring the best people they can.
* Or what if the important mechanism is just the entrepreneurs hiring people that are more similar to them--thus looking for high specific human capital.
