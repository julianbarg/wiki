* Biology, Duke University
* 37,000 river restauration projects ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20090422152409/http://www.restoringrivers.org/newsite/nbii.html]])
* 317 interviews

## One-sentence summary

The authors were hoping to identify variables that render river restoration projects successful. After collecting data on 37,000 river restoration projects in the US and interviewing 317 project managers, the authors discover that river restoration is not driven by science. Only 10% of the documents indicate that specific metrics were tracked throughout the project, whereas 46% of interviewees indicated the use of success criteria. Yet, the interviews also indicate that 65% of projects were considered completely successful by the project manager.
