## One-paragraph summary
This call for papers briefly summarizes multiple streams of literature within the topic area of temporality that authors could contribute to. The central concept are a focus on action and agency, and, specifically, temporal work. Temporal work describes organizational efforts to use temporality (or rather, the interpretation thereof) to guide strategic action. Pathways to temporal work include event-time versus clock-time based pacing (managers can manipulate event-time but not clock-time), the diverging pacing of different units and levels, sustainability and temporality, and the pacing of the environment.
