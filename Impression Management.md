[[Gaim, Clegg & Cunha 2021]]        | VW achieved the impossible through cheating, surfacing the dark side of paradox.
[[Quigley et al 2020]]              | Some CEOs game compensation systems by releasing bad news before stock option grants.
[[Cole & Chandler 2019]]            | Shows the competitive IM by Edison and a competitor, where public institutions are the judge.
[[Carlos & Lewis 2018]]             | When reports mention e.g., protests or boycot threats a firm is less likely to disclose a positive environmental signal--DJSI certification.
[[Busenbark & Fitza 2017]]          | Firms that foreshadow acquisition announcements in a seasoned equity offering face less negative reactions.
[[Hayward & Fitza 2017]]            | Firms use precision--a narrow spread in earning call forecasts--to signal confidence.
[[Whittington, Yakis-Douglas & Ahn 2016]]| CEO public presentations constitute effective IM which elicit positive reactions.
[[McDonnel & King 2013]]            | Firms respond to negative claims by social movements with their own positive claims.
[[Bansal& Clelland 2004]]           | Higher legitimacy lowers unsystematic risks, release of negative information increases it. 
[[Elsbach, Sutton & Principe 1998]] | Firms use routine communications for anticipatory impression management.
