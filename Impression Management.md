[[Quigley et al 2020]]          | Some CEOs game compensation systems by releasing bad news before stock option grants.
[[Cole & Chandler 2019]]        | Shows the competitive IM by Edison and a competitor, where public institutions are the judge.
[[Bansal& Clelland 2004]]       | Higher legitimacy lowers unsystematic risks, release of negative information increases it.
