## Summary

Subcontractors were installing a gauge pole in a storage tank at the McRae terminal. Two mistakes occured. The tank had been cleaned by a subcontractor, but (1) only one floor instead of the whole structure [@PHMSA2009 p. 3]. At 7AM, they had tested the air for explosive fumes. The explosion occured at 2:17PM, after they had returned to work (2) without testing for fumes again. Their testing equipment was later found in their truck [@PHMSA2009 p.5].
