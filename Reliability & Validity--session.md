* Title: "The inevitibility of change and building reliability for the unexpected"

### Slides

12 minutes per section, 12 minutes for conversation

* Opening
    * 1 slide--We evaluate learning in two ways--reliablity & validity
        * Take paragraph 1 of page 2
    * Parabel
        * The story I am going to tell you think about it as a parabel in four parts
        * You want to figure out who you are
        * What unexpected change are you wrestling with--or not yet wrestling with?
<!--        * The context is obscure, but the parabel works well-->
    * Context (slides 7-10, 14-15 of the slide deck)
* Five groups
    * Standard assumption--validity of idea, not location matters for learning
<!--    * Assumption--learning is about the quality of the new idea
    * Reality is--it is about the reliability/coalitions-->
        * "The view from nowhere"--Steven Shapen
    * Reality
        * All knowledge is relational
        * Parabel shows you--how context shapes the way people view the problem
            * Who--Assembling the team
            * Why--Motive and goals
            * How--Constructing causal claims
            * What--Proposing practice changes
            * Where--Coalition building
* Legitimacy/change/authority (politics of)
    * Picks up regulatory learning
    * Who--regulators (international maritime organization)--who is involved
    * Why--see "Motives and goals" section--why are they involved (motives and goals)--because demand has dried up
    * What & how--see "Causal claims" section
        * *Herald of Free Enterprise*--[[https://maritimecyprus.com/2016/03/06/flashback-in-history-herald-of-free-enterprise-capsized-and-sank-on-6-march-1987-2/]]
        * Label the picture
        * Details of the accidents
        * Reponse: SOLES 90--RORO design standards
<!--Note: the paper does--how IMO (attempted to) reestablish safety/legitimacy or roro ferries--what entrepreneurs face: how to reestablish tourism is safe--what we face: how to reestablish the classroom is safe-->
    * Where--Northern Europe vs Southern Europe, Mediterranean vs Baltic Sea--Costa concordia--arenas
    * Stop and think--"What models of the world has the unexpected events challenged?"/"Who has authority? (It may be customers and not regulators!) What are their goals and motives? What are the limits of their models? (Because they probably are not state of the art!) Where does support for those models come from?"--actively ask them about their organizations--relate this to your organization--make it specific--whats the who, what, why, where, how in your org--we can only generate consensus on very broad, general, unspecific ideas.
* Discovery (politics of)
    * Who--representatives from Estonia, Sweden, Finland
    * Why--"Motive and Goals"--Estline & country _Estonia_ vs. Sweden & Finland
    * How--see "Constructing causal claims" section, sinking undermines the legitimacy of the government, they want the causal explanation (p10--Constructing causal claims--"The final report..."--the bow visor was the most logical explanation), but there is a whole lot more to it
    * What--the bow visor seperating
        * [[https://www.thelocal.se/20200929/ms-estonia-disaster-hole-discovered-in-hull-of-ferry-that-claimed-852-lives/]]
    * Where--coalition building--competing national interests, competing approaches to governance (post-soviet vs. the west), technical expertise, 3x2 table (Estonia vs. Sweden & Finland)
    * Stop and think--"In your context, where is new knowledge coming from? Who has expertise? Who has new ideas? What are their goals and motives? What new causal models are they introducing? Where are the centers of expertise?"
* Scepticism (politics of)
<!--    * Who? German 'Group of Experts'--Assembling a team--Son in law added, bomb expert added...--start with the lawyer, and then whoever the hell he needed to make his case-->
    * Who & why--quote--" Regular press statements . . . strengthened the public opinion in the Nordic countries that the main blame for the catastrophe rested with the builders, Meyer Werft in Papenburg. This caused the Managing Director of the yard, Bernard Meyer, to instruct his lawyer, Dr. Peter Holtappels, to form an own team of experts to investigate the real causes for the sinking of the ESTONIA. "
    * How/what? [[https://estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/images/report%20pics/folder%202/pg325.jpg]]
        * P 13, left column, last paragraph "For example..."--summarize that
        * Note: It is hard to pick from the range of pieces of ridiculous evidence that the GGOE assembled to make their case. But I had to pick one
        * "I have actually seen crew members working at the bow ramp many times by hammering, welding or cutting (burning). I have seen the gas bottles and considered it to be very dangerous. As I am quite familiar with the way the crews from ex Eastern Block countries work, I was, however, not too surprised."--pandering to German stereotypes of the time
    * Where--the victims' families--coalition building
    * Stop and think--"Who are the sceptics in your arena? What wisdom might they have for you? How can you engage their wisdom? What is the generative value of the doubt that they bring to the table?"
    <!--* So here is how it is that discovery proceed. Discovery does not proceed in a linear progression of new idea. It comes from doubts raised by people questioning orthodoxy. Schablonendenken-->
* Denial (politics of)
    * Who--Anders Bj√∂rkman & Jutta Rabe--two gadflies
    * Why--"Trying to uncover truths that they believe have been hidden"
        * "Moral imperative" thinking
    * How--"who should be held responsible" as guiding question 
        * "What human agency could have caused this"
        * "Thinking that some thing is planned, and somebody is to blame"
        * "These things don't fail"--Trained whales thinking
        * How do we hold them accountable?
    * "The alter native scenarios put the accident back into the political context and tried to hold someone accountable for the accident. Rabe stated this directly as her movie ends with a quote: 'The Governments of Sweden, Estonia, and Finland have not answered the question why people had to die, nor why their bodies remain at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.'"
    * What--human instead of technical cause: "who did this and why isn't anyone being held accountability"
    * Where--Individuals in the court of public opinion
    * Stop and think--"Who directly opposes the status quo, or change thereof? Who directly opposes the people in power? Who does not have voice? What are their moral dillemas? What moral dillemas do they raise? Who do these moral dillemas implicate? What moral dillemas motivate the denial?"
* Back end--"Who/what/why/how/where"

<!--* Stop and think--where collectively we get our value-->

<!--Thinking about it in the context of what I am doing, an what be valuable for us in terms of thinking about reliability and validity. What is the next step that we need to take to make it clear? What is the point of contestation between us & audience?

How do we translate that to my context, and contexts in general. How do we generalize this. What is he simplifying structure. What compelling examples can be used. What is the structure underneath the quadrants? A process model of how reliability & validity related. What Rerup & Zbaracki start talking about in tradeoffs. What is the value of the off-diagonals (CDC "Masks don' work" in order to safe masks".-->
