## One-sentence summary

Restoration of wetlands will naturally bring with it a return of mosquitos. This should not come as a surprise to stakeholders (but it will). Rather than focusing on pest control after the resoration, education efforts should take place beforehand. If the public decides to restore wetlands, maybe it should just accept the fact that this move will lead to a resurgance of mosquitos. Ecological approaches to pest control, such as the introduction of native fish species, should also be considered.
