### Independent variables

All independent variables are airline-country-year. A is the set of all airlines. C is the set of all countries.

* *Others' failure experience (within country)*: $W_{a,c,t} = \(\sum\limits_{\alpha \in \(A \backslash \\{a\\}\)} \(f_{\alpha,c,t-1}\) + 1/2\sum\limits_{\alpha \in \(A \backslash \\{a\\}\)} \(f_{\alpha,c,t-2}\) + 1/3 \sum\limits_{\alpha \in \(A \backslash \\{a\\}\)} \(f_{\alpha,c,t-3} \)\) * 6/11$
* *Others' failure experience (outside country)*: Same as above, but with second sum over the set of all countries, except vocal countries.
* *Population-level actor strength*: From regulatory audit carried out by ICAO.
* *Pop. actor strength* X *others' failure experience (within country)*

## One-paragraph summary

Madsen and Desai (2018) theorize that population-level factors affect vicarious learning of organizations. They show that rates of vicarious learning from others' failures vary across jurisdictions (H1). Further, that regulators' monitoring strength positively affects vicarious learning. And finally, they show for a subsample the ability of active regulators to positively affect failure rates.
