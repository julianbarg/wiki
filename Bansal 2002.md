## One-paragraph summary

Laying out an environmentally jarring situation and what corporations *should* do about it. The general line is: (1) environmental sustainability is crucial for our future. (2) Therefore, it is rational to respond to it. (3) Some corporations, but by far not all, are acting in accordance with principles of sustainable development. (4) Since sustainability is rational, and most corporations are not acting in accordance with the principles of sustainability, we just need to inform them. When they understand, they will act sustainable.
