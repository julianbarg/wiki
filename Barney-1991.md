## One-page summary
Barney (1991) suggests that the source of “sustained competitive advantage” for firms comes from firm-level resources (e.g. all assets, processes, information, knowledge). These firm-level resources need to have for attributes (valuable, rare, inimitable, non-substitutable) to constitute a competitive advantage over competitors. This competitive advantage ensures that the firm has its own value creating strategy that cannot be duplicated by both current and potential competitors. Thus, Barney (1991) stands in contrast to Industrial Organization (I/O) scholars, who look mostly at external factors including industry attractiveness, whereas Barney emphasizes unique firm resources, which mean that a firm "owns" its sustained competitive advantage. To provide further evidence that firms can sustain their competitive advantage by managing internal factors, the author makes two assumptions that deviate from the I/O perspective: 1) Firms within an industry can be heterogeneous in terms of their resource composition. 2) Resources are not always mobile across firms. Following is Barney's criticisms of the I/O perspective: both first-mover advantages and mobility barriers are not influential without resource heterogeneity and immobility. Under these modified assumptions, the paper provides four conditions for resources to provide a sustained competitive advantage: 1) Resources need to be valuable in that they enable firms to implement strategies to improve efficiency and effectiveness, 2) Resources need to be rare in that only small numbers of competitors may use the same resources as the focal firm to sustain competitive advantage , 3) Resources need to be inimitable in that competitors cannot duplicate the focal firm’s strategy easily to take its sustained competitive advantage, and 4) Resources need to be non-substitutable in that no other resources are strategically equivalent to the focal firm’s resource.  

One line from Wernerfelt (1984) "products and resources are two sides of a coin" implies the theoretical gap between I/O perspective and RBV. As Priem and Butler (2001) explain, Barney (1991) successfully criticizes how the former I/O scholars have underestimated the complexity of the resource side, demonstrating that competition occurs not only in the market environment but also between firms within one industry. Along with Wernerfelt (1984) that focuses more on corporate-level strategies (across industries), Barney (1991), which emphasizes business-level strategies (within an industry), establishes the theoretical background of the Resource Based View. Barney (1991), thus, justifies that firms may adopt different strategies in the resource side, rather than simple positioning strategies (e.g. product differentiation, cost reduction) in the product market suggested by Michael Porter. The weakness of the paper comes mostly from its conceptualization issues (refer to my summary on Priem and Butler(2001)) 

The contribution of Barney (not only 1991 paper) is huge in the RBV research stream. Not only Barney (1991) is the piece that builds the theoretical background of the RBV, his discussion with Priem and Butler (2001) helps RBV scholars to develop the whole research stream, complementing his original ideas on the resource side.  

In last session, we have discussed regarding the SCP paradigm focusing on the importance of industries to create and capture value. Since Barney (1991) suggests that his approach complements the I/O perspective, how can we empirically show two perspectives together?  Even though, we read Rumelt (1991) suggesting variance decomposition model, I think a causal mechanism need to be shown!
