## One-paragraph summary

Discussing the effect of power on learning. Two cases: in one case, a clear structure and hierarchy, with a routinized management approach (including contact with stakeholders) led to exploitative learning. In the other case, high ambitions and a value based approach, in conjunction with a "loosely structured environmental management system" (ibid., 257) led to explorative learning.
