## Important points
* "In general, it is easier to interpret noncognitive changes as mere 'changes' than as 'improvements'" (p. 17).
* "Managers or firms have to perform as well as competitors; they need not take optimal actions, or even good actions, unless their competitors are taking equally effective actions" (p. 18). Within firms, relates to managers and immediate colleagues.

## Reactions
* How would organizations even detect lack of success? All subunits are obliged to justify their existence and their actions. These are the machines that produce justification for continuance, constantly, non-stop.
* Maybe strategic learning is flawed, but learning with regard to technologies could still work?
