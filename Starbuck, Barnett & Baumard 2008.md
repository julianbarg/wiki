## One-paragraph summary

Differentiating between cognitive and noncognitive learning. Cognitive learning relies on correct mental maps that guide organizational action. Noncognitive learning occurs as a result of performance feedback from the environment. Noncognitive learning can later entail cognitive learning. The authors conclude that inferences are as likely to be helpful as they are likely to lead to negative results. There is a weak relationship between organizational behavior and success, a more important factor is peers' behavior.

## Important points
* "In general, it is easier to interpret noncognitive changes as mere 'changes' than as 'improvements'" (p. 17).
* "Managers or firms have to perform as well as competitors; they need not take optimal actions, or even good actions, unless their competitors are taking equally effective actions" (p. 18). Within firms, relates to managers and immediate colleagues.
* [F]or most firms, strategic learning merely acts as a generator of change. These changes can stimulate complx strategic interactions without altering overal survival rates across the population of firms." (p. 19).

## Reactions
* How would organizations even detect lack of success? All subunits are obliged to justify their existence and their actions. These are the machines that produce justification for continuance, constantly, non-stop.
* Maybe strategic learning is flawed, but learning with regard to technologies could still work?
