## Why?

Some might have the notion that now something is really happening with regard to climate change. That is probably not the case, as the above quotes show. Document a wrong sense of progress. Motivate concrete research rather than the "big debates". The evidence for recently trending environmental crisis and renaissance of environmental thought can be spun two ways--either, we are close to a breakthrough--because we are finally paying attention!--or we are in a crisis, because sustainability is trending but we are not achieving anything.

Maybe, (some) corporations have always (never) been seriously looking at the environment. Maybe, there has always been some (little) serious conversation on the environment. Maybe since the Great Smog of London, or even before.

## Environmental Crisis

### @Shrivastava1994

> At the present time, when environmental crises proliferate around the world, nature-centred organizational theories are particularly important. Examples of these crises include, depletion of stratospheric ozone, air pollution, acid rain, global warming, loss of biodiversity, extinction of non-renewable resources, toxic wastes, major industrial accidents, transportation accidents, and other technological risks to the public.

### @Hart1995

> [A]ir and water pollution, toxic emissions, chemical spills, and industrial accidents have created regional environmental and public health crises for thousands of communities around the world (Brown, Kane, & Roodman, 1994; Shrivastava, 1987). The composition of the atmosphere has been altered more in the past 100 years-through fossil-fuel use, agricultural practices, and deforestation-than in the previous 18,000 (Graedel & Crutzen, 1989). Climate changes, which might produce both rising ocean levels and further desertification, could threaten the very fabric of human civilization as we know it (Schneider, 1989). The world's 18 major fisheries already have reached or exceeded maximum sustained yield levels (Brown & Kane, 1994). If current consumption rates continue, all virgin tropical forests will be gone within 50 years, with a consequent loss of 50 percent or more of the world's species (Wilson, 1989). [...]

during the past 40 years to the point where they are now having impacts

### @Bansal2002

> The environmental, social-equity, and economic threats facing our society are clear. In 1996, 25 percent of the world's approximately 4,630 mammal species and 11 per cent of the 9,675 bird species were at significant risk of total extinction. In 1998, the highest temperatures ever were recorded. In the same year, 54 countries were hit by floods and 45 by drought. In 1999, 52,000 deaths were attributed to weather-related events. Poor sanitation, poverty, and disease threaten quality of life, especially in developing countries.

### @Bansal2019a

> When writing this Guidepost, three news stories broke within 2 weeks. First, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that the Earth is warming much faster than expected, so the planet may warm by 1.5°C by 2030—only 11 years after this Guidepost will be published (IPCC, 2018). Presently, the Earth is only one degree above pre‐industrial levels, but the frequency and span of wildfires, floods, and persistent droughts are causing havoc and taking human lives. Second, an article in Nature reported that the ocean has warmed 60 percent more than what was predicted by the worst estimate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Resplandy et al., 2018). Third, and maybe the most visual and profound, the World Wildlife Fund reported that 60 percent of the world’s wildlife had been wiped out from 1970 to 2014 (WWF, 2018).

## (Recent) Renaissance of Green Thought

### @Levy1997

> A growing number of business schools are offering EM [Environmental Management] courses and specilizations, and a variety of texts is now available specifically designed for such courses (Birchard, 1994; Buchholz, 1993; Friedman, 1993; Stead & Stead, 1996). New journals and conferences herald the awakening of academic interest in the field of EM. The more theoretical EM literature attempts to identify and describe paradigms of management according to their orientation toward the natural environment (Clair, Milliman, & Whelan, 1996; Egri & Pinfield, 1996; Purser et al., 1995; Rasanen, Merilainen, & Lovio, 1995). This literature generally critiques traditional management for being mechanistic and anthropocentric and for ignoring environmental constraints and externalities, then proceeds to describe and advocate new paradigms of management that incorporate ecological awareness to various degrees.

### @Banerjee2003

> In recent years there has been a minor explosion of articles dealing with corporate greening in the management literature. Much of this literature attempts to incorporate current notions of sustainable development into corporate strategy (see, for example, the 2000 special issue on the management of organizations in the natural environment in the Academy of Management Journal, the 1995 special issue on ecologically sustainable organizations in the Academy of Management Review, or the 1992 special issue on strategic management of the environment in Long Range Planning) and discusses the emergence of corporate environmentalism and organizational processes of environmental management (Banerjee 2001b; Crane 2000; Fineman 1996).

### @Whiteman2013

> Studies on corporate sustainability and climate change have increased significantly over the last few years despite a slow start (Goodall, 2008).

### @Ergene2020

> While some studies on the natural environment in management can be traced back to the beginning of the modern environmental movement in the 1970s (i.e., Gladwin & Welles, 1976), the topic did not become an object of significant research interest until the early 1990s with the first efforts to build a research community among management scholars (e.g., the Greening of Industry Network in 1989 and the Organizations and the Natural Environment special interest group of the Academy of Management in 1994, later to become a division in 2007) and the creation of academic journals dedicated to the interface between managerial action and environmental protection (e.g., Organization & Environment which was created in 1987 from its predecessor Industrial Crisis Quarterly, and Business Strategy and the Environment in 1991.

## Corporate Sustainability Trending

### @Hart1995

> During the past decade there has been tremendous pressure for firms to minimize or eliminate emissions, effluents, and waste from their operations. In 1986, for example, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) was passed in the United States, requiring that companies publicly disclose their emission levels of some 300 toxic or hazardous chemicals through what has become known as the toxic release inventory (TRI). Managers now understood the extent of their firms' impact on the environment and recognized that pollution stems from inefficient use of material and human resources. Indeed, the first year that the TRI was used (1988) revealed that U.S. companies alone emitted 10.4 billion pounds of toxic materials to the environment. This sobering realization caused management in the most affected industries-petrochemicals, pulp and paper, automotive, and electronics-to fundamentally rethink its approach to pollution abatement. In fact, since the late 1980s, a focus on emissions reduction and pollution abatement has swept industrial operations worldwide (Smart, 1992).

> [@Hart1995, p. 992]

### @Milne2006

> Business interest in the concept of sustainability appears to be increasing worldwide as evidenced through the emergence of various dedicated business associations, award schemes, reports and discussion documents on the implications of sustainability for business, as well as numerous environmental, management and accountancy consultancies positioning to offer businesses services connected with sustainability.
> 
> [@Milne2006, p. 802]

### @Montiel2014

> It is almost impossible to browse a company’s website or its official reports without finding references to “sustainability” or “sustainable development.” This has not always been the case. The past few years have brought an exponential increase in references to corporate sustainability (CS) and sustainable strategies. Business schools worldwide now hire professors in CS and most large companies hire employees to fill sustainability positions.
>
> [@Montiel2014, p.113]

### @DesJardins2016

> Almost 30 years after the Brundtland Report, “sustainable” is regularly used today to modify an innumerable range of distinct and diverse activities, ranging from agriculture and architecture to zoning and zoos. [...] Sustainability has become ubiquitous within business, with virtually every division including management, marketing, investing, accounting, strategy, and operations developing sustainable models and practices. It is difficult to find a major corporation that does not issue an annual sustainability report; by one account 95% of the Global 250 issue annual sustainability reports. Cottage industries have arisen in such areas as sustainability consulting, ranking, investing and measurement. Major consulting firms including Ernst and Young, Deloitte, Accenture, PwC, and KPMG, and countless advocacy groups and NGOs, have created significant business ventures in sustainability consulting, advising businesses on how to become more sustainable. Forbes magazine, in conjunction with Global Knights Capital, publishes an annual ranking of the top 100 sustainable firms, the “Global100.” Virtually every brokerage and investment firm offers a sustainable portfolio, with the Dow Jones Sustainability Index perhaps the
most widely used sustainability investing guide. Similar to the Global100, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has created a sustainability measurement and assessment tool that is widely used by business and NGOs throughout the world. Another well-known major benchmarking framework is the “triple bottom line” (TBL), now widely cited in management literature and in sustainability consulting.

## (Recent) Societal Backlash

### @Purser1995

> Over the course of three decades, modern organizations have been the target of escalating criticism from environmentalists (Carson, 1962; Commoner, 1990; Devall & Sessions, 1985; McKibben, 1989; Orr, 1992; Rozak, 1979). Industry continues to face a media backlash that has heightened public concern over toxic wastes, exposures to environmental disasters and pollution, loss of biodiversity, ozone depletion, and greenhouse warming.

## Contradition

### @Whiteman2013

> Management research on corporate sustainability faces a paradox: on the one hand, sustainability is no longer a fringe topic and corporations routinely invest in eco-efficiency measures. On the other hand, data from ecological analyses indicate a worsening, and in some cases, alarming state of affairs.
