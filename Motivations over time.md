## Environmental Crisis

### @Shrivastava1994

> At the present time, when environmental crises proliferate around the world, nature-centred organizational theories are particularly important. Examples of these crises include, depletion of stratospheric ozone, air pollution, acid rain, global warming, loss of biodiversity, extinction of non-renewable resources, toxic wastes, major industrial accidents, transportation accidents, and other technological risks to the public.

### @Bansal2002

> The environmental, social-equity, and economic threats facing our society are clear. In 1996, 25 percent of the world's approximately 4,630 mammal species and 11 per cent of the 9,675 bird species were at significant risk of total extinction. In 1998, the highest temperatures ever were recorded. In the same year, 54 countries were hit by floods and 45 by drought. In 1999, 52,000 deaths were attributed to weather-related events. Poor sanitation, poverty, and disease threaten quality of life, especially in developing countries.

## (Recent) Renaissance of Green Thought

### @Ergene2020

> While some studies on the natural environment in management can be traced back to the beginning of the modern environmental movement in the 1970s (i.e., Gladwin & Welles, 1976), the topic did not become an object of significant research interest until the early 1990s with the first efforts to build a research community among management scholars (e.g., the Greening of Industry Network in 1989 and the Organizations and the Natural Environment special interest group of the Academy of Management in 1994, later to become a division in 2007) and the creation of academic journals dedicated to the interface between managerial action and environmental protection (e.g., Organization & Environment which was created in 1987 from its predecessor Industrial Crisis Quarterly, and Business Strategy and the Environment in 1991.
