Somehow, I got hung up on goals.

**Problem statement**: We have much change nowadays, but little meaningful change.

Two elements work toward an organization reducing its environmental footprint:

* Technology
* Learning

In parallel, a different concept applies along those two dimensions also. To increase efficiency/decrease environmental impact through:

* Getting better at what you do (learning)
* Changing what you do (technology)

The relationship between technology is unclear - sometimes, technology is subsumed under learning. Further, the learning progress I want to focus on is not entirely on the organzational level - I need to show the audience that organzational goals and suborganizational goals matter. So there should be a section of the work on organizational behavior and learning.

## Theoretical contributions

* Learning is *merely a metaphor* when we decompose is, by taking technology and resources (inspection/supervision) out of the equation, surprisingly little is left over. This leaves learning as a process of scaling up. This scaling up sometimes is not carried out in a "leapfrog" fashion (going to major economies of scale) because the market conditions are not known. But the mechanisms of learning - providing more specialized tools, retaining more specialized staff, improving the setup of a production *system* - all bear the hallmarks of economies of scale. We cannot tell economies of scale from learning, because companies start with large quantities in the second case from the get-go. But we only apply the label of learning or economies of scale post-ex. This makes learning potentially a weak theoretical concept, and in fact we see in the learning literature many ambiguities.
