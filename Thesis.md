Two elements work toward an organization reducing its environmental footprint:

* Technology
* Learning

The relationship between technology is unclear - sometimes, technology is subsumed under learning. Further, the learning progress I want to focus on is not entirely on the organzational level - I need to show the audience that organzational goals and suborganizational goals matter. So there should be a section of the work on organizational behavior and learning.
