**Problem statement**: We have much change nowadays, but little meaningful change.

Two elements work toward an organization reducing its environmental footprint:

* Technology
* Learning

In parallel, a different concept applies along those two dimensions also. To increase efficiency/decrease environmental impact through:

* Getting better at what you do (learning)
* Changing what you do (technology)

The relationship between technology is unclear - sometimes, technology is subsumed under learning. Further, the learning progress I want to focus on is not entirely on the organzational level - I need to show the audience that organzational goals and suborganizational goals matter. So there should be a section of the work on organizational behavior and learning.
