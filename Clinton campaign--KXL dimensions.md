> This makes her seem totally political.  Her reason for being against it is because “she can’t stay silent on an issue that matters to so many”?? She has been silent.  I don’t think this construct will fly.
> 
> I think structurally, we have to hang this on the dramatic changes since the application was filed in the 3rd graph.  And we have to make her a visionary on clean energy and environment, not the policy director in chief.

> Thursday would be better press-wise so it doesn't compete with her Iran speech on Wednesday.

> Joel, we pumped up the climate impacts but in discussing with Jake decided we do still need to address why she's making her position known, when she has previously said she will wait for the President to make a decision. Added a line about wanting to let voters know where she stands, and added a more expansive graf about making the US the leader in fighting climate change and becoming a clean energy superpower.

> [R]ight now you don’t have any sound bite that elevates her position and all that will get picked up is that she’s opposed to keystone. [...]
>
> I’m worried that if we don’t have something like [a single big idea that encapsulates her vision] we are light on her core values and beliefs on this issue and we are missing those [sic], she risks looking very political, especially on this.

> We have a couple of debate prep answers that use basically the same construction of the oped - wanting to give POTUS space, but needing to let voters know where she stands, and then pivoting to the infrastructure package.

> Is it easy/possible to put some number on the jobs?   …”creating hundreds of thousands good paying jobs”…  ?

> I would prefer language a little less bold from the labor perspective. I worry it will be interpreted to reflect on similar future projects.

> A jobs number would be a total guess and we don't have calculations (even KXL-booster-Republican-fuzzy-math quality calculations) to back up the inevitable fact check.

> How does that help us? We are have been challenged for not having a position and being strong in opposing is essential. Vague or less than clear direct language will reinforce weakness instead of showing strength.
>
> I think the graph as written lacks any impact, is circuitous and her statement needs to be super strong to get us past the fact that she hadn't taken a position.

> Given that we just offered an apology on emails that some reporters think happened "on a dime" after months of resistance, do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?
> 
> I think we could seem consistent with our past statements about not wanting to get ahead of POTUS on Keystone if her position merely leaked out of the labor meeting. That would seem like a private comment that she didn't intend to become public -- to an unfriendly audience, no less -- and so it might achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. I just worry that announcing our position so fulsomely in an oped amounts to leading with our chin and will inspire loud cries of hypocrisy from reporters.

> This has been bothering me as well. We repeatedly said we couldn't do this and then launch an op Ed without much explanation.

> HRC asking for language why she'd tell the building trades but not voters in NH or the press.

> I wholeheartedly agree with this. I just don't see how this won't come off as incredibly disingenuous, and I fear the crowd we are looking to placate is exactly the crowd that is most predisposed to seeing this move as purely political. We solve one problem and create another with the very same crowd, while upsetting those on the other side in the process. The irony of all of this is that while not recognized as such, her not taking a position is a pretty risky and honest move, particularly for so long. She was trying to respect the process and the WH. That's honorable even if we can never sell it that way.

> We are going around and around on the merry go round. I think Fallon's point is fine, but to Nick's we can't go in and out of that meeting with [NATBU] thinking she's on their side on this.
