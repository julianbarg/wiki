### Chapter 1

The internal characteristics of a firm matter. The behavior of the firm is not entirely determined by the environment. Cyert and March set out to develop a general theory of firms' economic decision making processes.

### Chapter 5

#### The Firm as an Adaptive Institution

Regards the firm as an _adaptively rational_ systems rather than as an _omnisciently rational_ system. States that long-run rationality is not relevant for theorizing, because we live in a world of short-run adaptive reactions. The subject of study should therefore be standard operating procedures, and how these change within observable time periods (modestly, does not consider larger changes).

## Important points
* "The conditions required for the non-fortuitous achievement of strictly rational behavior are extremely implausible as descriptions of the world." (p. 119)
