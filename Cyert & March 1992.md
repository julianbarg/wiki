### Chapter 1

The internal characteristics of a firm matter. The behavior of the firm is not entirely determined by the environment. Cyert and March set out to develop a general theory of firms' economic decision making processes.

### Chapter 5

#### The Firm as an Adaptive Institution

Regards the firm as an _adaptively rational_ systems rather than as an _omnisciently rational_ system. States that long-run rationality is not relevant for theorizing, because we live in a world of short-run adaptive reactions. The subject of study should therefore be standard operating procedures, and how these change within observable time periods (modestly, does not consider larger changes).

#### Standard operating procedures

Specific operating procedures, specifically _task performance rules_, _continuing records and reports_, _information handling rules_, and _plans_ change slowly and give stability to organizations. Standard operating procedures can be transfered (e.g., to new employees). Previous learnin is encoded in the procedures, and they also act to provide unique solutions and thus make behavior more predictable for other members (since most tasks do not provide unique solutions). 

## Important points
* "The conditions required for the non-fortuitous achievement of strictly rational behavior are extremely implausible as descriptions of the world." (p. 119)
