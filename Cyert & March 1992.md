## Chapter by chapter summary

### Chapter 1

The internal characteristics of a firm matter. The behavior of the firm is not entirely determined by the environment. Cyert and March set out to develop a general theory of firms' economic decision making processes.

### Chapter 5

#### The Firm as an Adaptive Institution

Regards the firm as an _adaptively rational_ systems rather than as an _omnisciently rational_ system. States that long-run rationality is not relevant for theorizing, because we live in a world of short-run adaptive reactions. The subject of study should therefore be standard operating procedures, and how these change within observable time periods (modestly, does not consider larger changes).

#### Standard operating procedures

Specific operating procedures, specifically _task performance rules_, _continuing records and reports_, _information handling rules_, and _plans_ change slowly and give stability to organizations. Standard operating procedures can be transfered (e.g., to new employees). Previous learnin is encoded in the procedures, and they also act to provide unique solutions and thus make behavior more predictable for other members (since most tasks do not provide unique solutions). Many of the decisions in a firm are standardized, including planning activities. If the kind of information included and their sources are standardized (and as long as previous experience on a similar outcome are available), the planning activities are little more than ceremony. Only when the organization faces major failure will it engage in search.

### Chapter 6

Cyert and March guide the reader through a specific example that lays out how the behavioral theory plays out in practice. For a retail department store, a missed sales goal would be the trigger for adjustments. These adjustments are predetermined however: the store has routines, e.g., for renegotiating prices with suppliers, for marking down items, and for introducing new items in response to missed sales goals. Similar routines exist for mark-up goals. March and Olsen than show some of the very specific routines for setting prices that they observed. They demonstrate that their behavioral model, rather than a model of an *objectively rational* system can predict pricing decisions.

### Chapter 7

#### Goals, expectations, and choice

**Goals**:

* Change when new members arrive.
* Are determined for an area by the subunit in charge of an area.
* Goals are evoked by problems.

**Aspiration level**--determined by:

* Past goal
* Past performance
* Past performance of peers

Search is induced when expectations are not met, and when slack is available.

#### Four major relational concepts

At the core of this work are four concepts: (1) quasi resolution of conflict, (2) uncertainty avoidance, (3) problematistic search, and (4) organizational learning.

**(2) Uncertainty avoidance**

Organizations avoid planning for uncertain future events. Rather, plans are made where mechanisms exist to later ensure conformity to these plans. Overall, organizations function more as "fire departments" that react to diversions from plans where they occur. Established "industry practice" allows even for prediction of events in the external environment.

**(3) Problematistic search**

Problems, such as failure to satisfy goals, motivates search. Search starts in the proximity of the problem (e.g., in the same department), and only becomes more distance if a solution is not found in the proximity.

**(4) Learning**



## Important points
* "The conditions required for the non-fortuitous achievement of strictly rational behavior are extremely implausible as descriptions of the world." (p. 119)

## Reactions
* The fact that learning is observed just means that an organization just thought a metric was important enough to track it. If it is not being tracked, we will not learn it (cause how would we?). There is further a publication bias to the learning literature. So the findings of the learning curve literature do not change our findings--we just hold that organizations can make progress in specific metrics when they track them. Thus, it is also unsurprising that firms grow--they select a metric, and they decide to grow it. Because previous years' performance is a reference point, they do not suddenly reach a gigantic size--they grow gradually.
