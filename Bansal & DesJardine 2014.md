## One-paragraph summary
Bansal and DesJardine bring the role of temporality in business sustainability into sharper focus. They point out that the promotion of responsiblity (CSR) does not automatically lead lead to greater sustainability (over time). For instance, a company might generate greater value for its shareholders and society at the current point in time, yet by doing so use up valuable resources that society (and the firm) will need in the future. In its clearest form, this problem is exemplified by short-termism. The value of many economic products is calculated as NPV, which values financial returns in the near future higher, at the expense of future returns.
