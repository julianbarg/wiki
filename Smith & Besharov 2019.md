## One-paragraph summary
The case study of a hybrid organization: a social enterprise that hopes to teach residents of rural villages in developing countries how to use computers, and provide them with jobs in data entry. The management of the social enterprise pursues both a social and a business mission. When it deviates too far from one mission, the organization "bumps against guard rails", initiating a trend in the other direction.
