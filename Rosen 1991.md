## One-page summary

We are moving in the constructionist realm and trying to interpret observations. The author acknowledges that ethnographic works are a product of its context. There is value in the work if it provides a plausible explanation, even if other explanations exist--the goal is capturing that alternative account.

With regard to organizations, we construct or observe rules--these rules are not what predict behavior however, instead, it is how the observer renders organizational behavior intelligible. Organizational ethnography is typicall auto-ethnography, as the researcher studies "his own" people. Ethnographer is "liv[ing] among those who are the data" (p. 5), to explore why and how they construct their social world. She coconstructs the organization's social reality by participating and observes *meaning* in that context.

When writing a study, the ethnographer should showcase both the "thick description" that allowed her to identify meaning in the context, and a "diagnosis" of what is at the heart of the issue, a very focused development of a theory.
