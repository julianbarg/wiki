### Key Concepts 
McPherson and Sauder (2013) flip the prevailing thinking on Institutional Logics from a driver of complexity for individuals (Marquis and Lounsbury 2007) to one of opportunity for individuals.  The key question that the authors implicitly ask is how the micro-level of institutional logics affect the nature of the forces inherent in the logics.  By examining institutional logics at the micro-level, the authors describe logics as a set of “tools” that can be deployed by individuals in specific settings.  Prior to this study, logics were interpreted by scholars as imposing several conflicting viewpoints on individuals and that individuals carried out competing logics in a relatively normative manner (i.e. logics were tied to histories that influenced a way of thinking in societies).  Examining logics at the micro-level, therefore, disentangled the historical component and allowed for the impact that logics had on individual decision-making and the ability to exercise agency.  In this way, McPherson and Sauder (2013) speak directly to scholars of institutional logics and institutional theory in order to expand upon the way in which societal forces are leveraged by individuals. 

### Findings & Contributions 
To examine micro-level logics, McPherson and Sauder (2013) conduct an ethnography at a drug court with a particular focus on four parties within the organization of a drug court: probation officers, clinicians, public defenders, and State’s attorneys.  By immersing themselves in the court, the authors uncovered 4 potential logics at play in a drug court: criminal punishment, rehabilitation, community accountability, and efficiency.  In this manner, logics are best defined as “pre-programmed” ways of dealing with drug offenders (i.e. the taken-for-granted approach to dealing with drug offenders and sentencing).  By coding their data in such a way that allowed for counts of institutional logics, the authors uncovered 460 cases in which logics were present over a 15-month period.  In 107 of these cases (approximately 25%), logics were invoked by the individual and did not follow the default logic that would be predicted.  It is important to note that the majority of cases followed the prevailing thinking of logics as forces; therefore, the authors are not fully disputing the research on institutional logics and are merely extending the thinking to allow for agency in specific instances. 

In focusing on the 107 cases where logics were invoked, the authors identify that individuals deployed multiple logics that were often contrary to their “home” logic.  In a sense, specific actors would deploy a logic counter to the traditional logic of their profession in order to influence an outcome (in this case, the judgment on a drug offender).  By demonstrating that logics were “hijacked,” the authors effectively demonstrate the parallel between logics as tools that can be deployed by individuals for specific ends.  The key finding is that actors pragmatically and creatively invoke logics for their own desired purposes.  In this sense, logics are not entirely one-direction in the sense that they emerge from the environment and impose a force on individuals.  The individual, rather, can select from a menu of logics and deploy a way of thinking in specific contexts. 

### What Questions are Unanswered? 

While the authors attempt to address the question of why logics are used in unexpected ways, the depth of the response is incomplete and McPherson and Sauder acknowledge as much.  A question of modus operandi versus personal legitimacy appears to be an opportunity.  Do individuals deploy logics based on biases toward a specific result or are they effectively playing chess (i.e. siding with a hijacked logic today in order to deploy a home logic in the future to be seen as collaborative and open-minded).  Furthermore, the nature of the contexts where logics are deployed would be interesting, particularly in organizations that are hierarchical.  How would individuals deploy logics in the face of authority figures?  Nonetheless, McPherson and Sauder (2013) contribute considerably to the institutional logics literature by expressing the presence of agency.
