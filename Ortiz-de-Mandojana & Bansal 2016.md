## One-paragraph summary

Ortiz-de-Mandojana and Bansal (2016) hypothesize that the relationship between resilience and organizational performance plays out over the long term. They test this empirically by matching a sample of companies in the KLD 400 with non-KLD 400 companies. The companies with more SEPs are hypothesized to be more resilient (resilience plays out over the long term) and as a result experience less financial volatility, a stronger long-term growth, and higher rates of survival than their non-KLD 400 peers.
