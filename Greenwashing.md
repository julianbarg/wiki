## Greenwashing a theory, phenomenon, or umbrella term

There are two streams of literature. Some articles study greenwashing as a phenomenon, while others view it as a theory. For instance, @Lyon2015 note with regard to _greenwashing-as-phenomenon_ that the "[p]opular usage of the term _greenwash_ encompasses a range of communications that mislead people into adopting overly positive beliefs about an organization’s environmental performance" (p. 225, emphasis in original). With regard to _greenwashing-as-theory_, they refer to @Lyon2011, who define greenwashing as "[s]elective disclosure of positive information about a company’s environmental or social performance, without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive corporate image" (p. 9). To meet halfway, greenwashing can be described as "an _umbrella term_ for a whole family of behaviors that induce people to hold overly positive views of an organization’s environmental performance" [@Lyon2015, 244, emphasis added].

## Some observations

* @Laufer2003 and @Ramus2005 are highly cited likely because they were first, not because of depth.
