[[_TOC_]]

## One-paragraph summary

Organizations might find it cheaper to respond to demands for greening by greenwashing rather than to clean up their act. On the organizational level, (1) the incentive structure, (2) organizational inertia, or (3) flaws in intra-firm communication may contribute to greenwashing.
