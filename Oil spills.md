## To do
* Add data on wall diameter, thickness, and maximum yield strength?
* Track change of regulations in response to Safety Recommendations (especially  P-84-27, P-84-28, and P-84-30 from the [[San Bernadino train disaster]]).

## Questions

* Is the number of pipeline spills a predictor of subsquent spill volume? That would provide me with an avenue for inquiry - there is a definitve feedback from the environment, but it is not utilized. Because low-level activities, especially controllers, are ignored.

## Secondary sources

### Leak detection systems

> It has been clear for years that these computerized leak-detection systems don't work,[...] [t]he question for me is why have regulators continued  to allow the pipeline industry to keep selling the public on leak detection systems that don't work as advertised?

> If you get a thousand [false alarms] a month, what happens when ylu get a big [real] one? [...] How do you tell the difference? You can't.

> Allen, the UTSI consultant, said experienced controllers can recognize the warning signs even before the system sounds an alarm. But because they're usually busy making sure batches of oil are delivered to the right destinations, they're not necessarily looking at the hydraulic data used for leak detection.
