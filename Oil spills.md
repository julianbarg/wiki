## Theorie development
* [[Pipeline safety learning]]

## Literature
* [[Perrow 1984]]

## Incidents
* [[Seminole '92]]
* [[Houston '94]]
* [[Calnev '89]]
* [[Olympic Pipeline '99]]
* [[Chevron '02]]

## To do
* Add data on wall diameter, thickness, and maximum yield strength?
* Track change of regulations in response to Safety Recommendations (especially  P-84-27, P-84-28, and P-84-30 from the [[San Bernadino train disaster]]).

## Questions

* Is the number of pipeline spills a predictor of subsquent spill volume? That would provide me with an avenue for inquiry - there is a definitve feedback from the environment, but it is not utilized. Because low-level activities, especially controllers, are ignored.
