## One-page Summary
The main contribution of the article is an empirical test of the evolutionary theory posited by Nelson and Winter (1982). Specifically it draws on the perspective of dual-routines view (based on Carnegie school). In doing so, the author shows that managers make a difference in organizing, and performance (Henderson and Cockburn 1994, Lieberman et al. 1990) beyond the external forces as explained by modern organizational theory (e.g., resource dependence, institutional theory, population ecology). First, the author provides a summary of the dual-routines view, and extends it to a strong-form dual-routines view. Next, the author operationalizes the theory in an empirical analysis of the franchise business model.  

The dual-routines view is a revival of Simon's (1945) view that general managers play a critical role in maintaining the balance between internal efficiency and external responsiveness. What Simon described as administrator and legislator are redefined in terms of the administrative role and entrepreneurial role performed by hierarchical managers. These roles contribute to operational routines and meta-routines respectively. The operational routines are mostly focused on the internal environment of the organization that plays a coordination role, and binds organization into a cohesive whole without conscious effort. The meta-routines are mainly focused on the external environment of the organization, and are responsible for modifying various aspects of operational routines over time, in order to innovate or to adjust to the environment. The point of departure of the strong form of the dual-routines view from the broad dual-routines view is that the strong form assumes an impulsive model of man, as opposed to a rational one. The impulsive man view assumes managerial attention, even when the incentives are aligned with the desired behaviour. Consequently, the managers also make a difference to operational routines, in addition to the meta-routines. The empirical setting of the article is based on the franchise relationships. Based on the theoretical arguments around the strong form of the dual-routines view, the author posits two hypotheses as follows: 

**H1**: The franchisor creates value in perpetuity by enforcing operational routine (even after the franchisee has assimilated it). 

**H2**:  The franchisor creates value in perpetuity through a meta-routine that introduces innovation into the operational routine.

The author collects data for a particular high performance firm’s (and additional qualitative data for another low performance firm) franchisees over a period of time. During this time period, some of the franchisees part ways from the franchisor, and start working independently. The context is treated as a natural experiment, and accordingly, the hypotheses around the treatment (separated franchisees) and the control (continuing franchisees) groups are tested. The main DVs of the study are performance measures (revenue and sales), and the main predictor variable is time of independence/ separation from the franchisor. The model is evaluated in two stages, where in the first stage the panel data are regressed to estimate impact of separation on performance. In second stage, cross sectional data collected through surveys in terms of admin and entrepreneurial compliance after separation are regressed using the system of equations approach, to show that the separation impacts performance, through the routine (non)compliance.

Overall the results support the hypotheses. The caveat in the interpretation, and applicability of the results is the selection on unobservables. The last lag of the system of equations approach attempts to model the selection variables to explain why a particular franchisee decides to part ways from the franchisor. The problem here is that none of the predictors of the selection were found to be significant. Which means, that we still don’t know the exact reason of why the former franchisees actually decided to separate (except the qualitative infernnces). Because of this limitation, it is hard to confidently say that the treatment and the control groups are comparable. And, if they are not comparable, the conclusions derived may also not be imperative.
