## One-paragraph summary

Focuses on small groups, which were supposed to make companies more nimble. Bresman (2010) finds that these groups engage in "anticipatory search", that they learn vicariously not only when search would be called for because of performance below aspiration (Cyert and March 1963). He notes that often, actors that want to learn are provided with data to learn from, and there is a lack of focus on this in the learning literature.
