## One-paragraph summary

Greenwashers use another language than implementors. Implementors use exclusive language ("but", "only", "if" etc.) to qualify their statements, whereas greenwashers use more inclusive language such as "and", and "additionally". The mental load of being less trushfull and carefully scripting language is mentally taxing, hence the language used is more simple. Specialist stakeholders may be able to see through. Authors also consider the possibility that stakeholders have a stake in the companies success, and thus incur a bias when observing the company's performance.
