## One-paragraph summary

Near-misses lead to complacency rather than urgency, although they could warn of future danger. That is because near-misses are (wrongly) perceived to be similar to success. Experiencing near-misses can normalize risk taking, as it reduces individuals' perceived risk (ibid., 1433). Managers who experience a near-miss are not seen as less capable than successful managers. But observers do find near-misses surprising. The reason why they still do not interpret them as less successful is because the risk gets normalized. As a result, risk taking is perpetuated. Managers who take risks and are successful or experience a near-miss are treated equally. Thus, there is a reward for the risk, where there is no reward for no risk being taken.
