## One-paragraph summary
This paper sets out to study capabilities on a firm level, to provide empirical evidence for the RBV/Dynamic Capabilities research stream. 

## One-page summary

In the literature of resource-based view (RBV), important concepts include resource, competitive advantage, sustained competitive advantage, and competence. This paper delves into the concept of competence. The authors identify two types of competence: component competence and architectural competence. Component competence refers to the local abilities or knowledge, similar to the concept of resource in RBV literature. Architectural competence refers to the ability to integrate component competences. This is similar to the concept of dynamic capability, which is defined as managerial ability to organize in order to renew competences and adapt to changing environments, put forward by [[Teece, Pisano and Shuen 1997|Teece Pisano and Shuen 1997]]. In this paper, the authors investigate the impact of component and architectural competences on productivity of drug discovery in pharmaceutical research. 

The independent variables are component and architectural competences, and the dependent variable is the productivity of drug discovery. This study is using a combination of quantitative data, from which the authors measure component competence (KPATS, the stock of patents obtained in each program), and qualitative data, from which the authors measure architectural competence (PROPUB: scientific orientation, CROSS: cross disciplinary exchange, DICTATOR: single individual commands resource allocation, GLOBAL: seamless global research), from 10 major pharmaceutical firms. The level of analysis are the research programs within firms, and the authors use Poisson regression. The overall result shows that component competence has a positive and significant impact, and two of architectural competences—PROPUB and DICTATOR—are significant (PROPUB positive and DICTATOR negative). 

### Discussions 
The contribution of this paper is that it defines competences in a more precise manner than the previous literature of RBV, where the definition of competences seemed vague, and the concept was used interchangeably with other concepts, such as resources and capabilities. Furthermore, it is notable that this paper adds a more dynamic character to competences of firms. Early literature of RBV focused on acquiring VRIN (valuable, rare, inimitable, non-substitutable) resources that will result in sustained competitive advantage once and for all. Here, the authors imply that the acquisition of VRIN resources is not the ultimate solution; it is how such resources are managed, so that firms can adapt to the changes in environment and renew their resources. However, a weakness of this paper, as the authors have mentioned, is the measurement issue. The architectural competence measurements are all measured on a 5-point Likert scale, which seems quite arbitrary. In addition, architectural competence measurements are problematic due to endogeneity. In other words, the architectural competence, the explanatory variable, is correlated with the error term, which may include unobserved determinants of research productivity. Heckman correction may help improve the methodology of this paper as Shaver (1998) noted.
