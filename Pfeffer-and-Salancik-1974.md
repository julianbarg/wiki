### Theoretical underpinnings and contribution
How are decisions made in organizations? While scholarship prior to publication of this article had highlighted how hierarchies (bureaucratic model), collegial (professional model) and power dynamics (political model), all could possibly help answer this broad question, the authors clearly seem to agree with Baldridge’s assertion that the political model is “more accurate description of reality”. This is the theoretical foundation on which the authors build. 

More specifically, the authors explore the relationship between sub-unit (departmental) power and resource (budget) allocations for a single case of a mid-western University (namely, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign). In a nut-shell they argue that the more powerful a department, the higher its ability to attract budget resources, independent of departmental work load and student demand. 

### Methods
Given past research which has found budget allocations as a quantitative artefact and a concrete crystallization of the unobserved, underlying “political nature of organizational decision making” (March, 1962; Cyert and March, 1963), the authors see merit in having budget allocations as their dependent variable. The research context they chose is the setting of UIUC and budget allocations for 29 departments (representing major fields of study and covering most colleges at UIUC) were reviewed for a 13-year period (culminating into a data-set of 29 x 13 = 377 data points). 

On the other hand, in terms of independent variables, given the nebulous/ tenuous position of power in social science literature (March, 1966), multiple measures of power of sub-unit power are developed, namely – interview ratings from the department heads of the power of all departments and ratings of departmental representation on 13 major committees (source – university archives). The other independent variable taken into account is bureaucratic criteria for allocation in the form of number of graduate students and instructional units – IUs. The authors hypothesize that budget allocation decisions are influenced and are a result of a political process in which both sub-unit power and bureaucratic criteria play a roll. 

### Results and their limitations
While the authors find support for their hypotheses and defend themselves against alternative explanations and endogeneity due to variables like size, I found the empirical framework to be under-developed. The measures, especially for operationalizing sub-unit power and bureaucratic criterion, I submit, are quite coarse and crude and don’t necessarily capture these variables with high precision. Moreover, it would have been helpful that during the interviews of the department heads, some qualitative data was additionally collected on the process of budget allocation. Furthermore, while a 13-year sample may give a sense that they take a longitudinal perspective and hence take into account the history of any department (and how power may have evolved during this period of time), it can be argued that in terms of history of disciplines and universities, 13 years may be a short duration and may not give a sense of the emergence, growth and dominance of a certain discipline (say, engineering) given the history of the region in which the University finds itself embedded (here UIUC, it can be argued, may be influenced by the emergence, growth and dominance of large manufacturing firms in the mid-west) and how there may be reputational/ status spill-over effects.  

Further, it is important to understand what the general budget allocations compose of. Are these payroll budgets (salary budgets)? Equipment purchase budgets? One can argue that there are components of the budget that are non-negotiable and dependent on factors like size (payroll), nature of the department (need for lab equipment), etc. and for many of these components, hence may leave minimal room for influence.
