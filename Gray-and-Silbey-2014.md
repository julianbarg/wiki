## One-paragraph summary

Using a plethora of different theories to explain compliance or noncompliance. Theorized to make an impact are upper-level and middle-level management as well as lower-level actors. Logics are applied, but viewed as a tool rather than a determinant. Different possible interpretations of regulators are developed: as threat, obstacle or ally.

* In their own words:

"Rather than rest on either side of an unfruitful divide (individual person vs. organization as actor), we identify the sources of variation in organizational governance in terms of the hierarchical structure and distribution in resources (i.e., autonomy, expertise, experience) and thus bridge the gap between an individualist, micro account of organizational failure as propounded in the bad actor models and macro accounts of the organization qua organization as the actor or unit of analysis. Also calls for regulator to be taken serious though, despite the co-creation of implementative action by individuals in organizations, citing BP oil spill as prime example (ibid., 137).
