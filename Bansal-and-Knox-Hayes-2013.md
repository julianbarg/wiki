## One-page summary

Bansal and Know-Hayes 2013 discuss an important case (*carbon markets*) of time-space compression in the modern economy (specifically, sociomateriality). The natural environment posses certain attributes that organizations, which are social in nature, lack. Specifically, the authors question the ability of global carbon markets to reflect the attributes of the physical world, in terms of materiality and temporality. The authors call for a renewed study of time and space, especially with regards to the compression of time and space that takes place in organizations, but not in the natural environment.
