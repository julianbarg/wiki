## Important points
* "The study of organizational learning has suffered from three particularly conspicuous problems. The first is the tendency to define learning both as improvement and as a particular set of processes. This makes learning a good thing by definition and begs the question of when particular learning processes do or do not lead to intelligent behavior." (ibid., xi)
* "The proposition that learning improves chances for survival often seems to reduce either to the tautological proposition that improvemem leads to improvement, or to the false proposition that learning processes invariably lead to improvement" (ibid., xi).
* "[F]eatures of learning [...] can lead one astray" (ibid., xii).

## One-paragraph summary

The important shortcomings of organizational learning literature:

* **(1)** Naive view of learning as improvement.
* **(2)** Ignoring ecological interactions.
* **(3)** Myopia of learning is understudied.
