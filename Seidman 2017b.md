### Parsons

Parsons is using European sociologists to develop a general theory. This general theory, as described in _The Structure of Social Action_, holds that individuals are capable of voluntary action--however, that this voluntary action is also an expression of the individuals subjectiv interests and values, which in turn are influenced by larger trends. By developing this theory, Parsons seeked to supplant both materialism and individualism, which he found to be flawed. Individualism would place the blame for individual failure on individuals, materialism would paint the individual as too passiv (if it placed the burden for taking care of the individual on society). Both ran counter to the idea of a modern capitalism, which takes care of individuals, while upholding a doctrin of individual, autonomous action. His theory was developed with the intent to provide a theory that could act as an "operating system" of Western societies--as he believed that societies are driven by belief systems, and the crises during his lifetime were an expression of the lack of a suitable "operating system.".

## Important points
