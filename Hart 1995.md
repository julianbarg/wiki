## One-paragraph summary

Making the connection between the resource-based view and natural resources. The only contribution of the natural environment to this view is the insight that we might do irreversable damage to the environment, which in turn would hurt business. Hence, the author prescribes (1) pollution prevention, (2) product stewardship, and (3) sustainable development. The author also lays out the expected contribution of those three strategies to sustained competitive advantage.
