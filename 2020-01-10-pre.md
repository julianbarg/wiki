## [[Coase 1960]]
* Looking from a purely economic perspective: which choice generates the overall greatest economic benefit.
* Does it matter who the benefits accrue to?
* Lack of discussion of power.

## [[Williamson 1976]]
Discussing the bidding for a monopoly.

Missing the UK problem of public transportation (although 6 other problems discussed on p.75).

Discussing different types of contracts:
* Once-for-all contracts
* Incomplete long-term contracts
* Recurrent short-term contracts

## [[Baron 2016]]

Why not mention citizens united? Fundamentally changes the balance.

Three levels of nonmarket strategy:
* Choice - where is the most favorable environment.
* Performance difference/Industry specific advantages.

## [[North 1991]]
* Typical enlightenment view of history.
* Highly normative view ("When Institutions Do Not Evolve"). What would be an alternative view that is more encompassing? Narrative: our society evolved, and institutions evolved at the same time. Therefore, other societies with different institutions cannot have evolved to the same degree.
* Risk: the illusion of control.

## Overall
* Lacking a process perspective.
* The assumption is that things converge into an economic equilibrium?
* But as phenomena unfold in real life, they are very much do not resemble a model.
* Also, in some cases it is fine if things are not strictly efficient. For instance, in the case of Airbus European citizens might be willing to pay a premium for international co-creation of technology, rather than to have the corporation centralized in one country.
* Coase would ask Baron about the marginal benefits of nonmarket strategy. Because Coase was concerned with overall outcomes. How would he respond.
