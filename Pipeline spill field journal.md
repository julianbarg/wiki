1. Residents lay out their experience with Enbridge after the spill. Enbridge is using the money it is obliged to spend on pipeline safety to increase the pipe diameter. Residents suffer again, this time from construction work, their backyards are ripped up. Enbridge pulling all tricks it can to avoid needing new permits.
* [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAR7z76KWj8]]
2. Initiative to prevent Enbridge to take more land under eminent domain law. Named after the 80 feet tract of land that Enbridge controls along its 300 miles long pipeline through Wisconsin.
* [[http://80feetisenough.org/]]
3. Oil industry preventing emergence of an informative database about fracking that could be used by stakeholders or for empirical work through deceptive "pseudo-disclosure".
* [[Avidan, Etzion & Gehman 2019]]
4. Summary of Enbridge's business practice, expansion plans, regulatory capture. E.g., one project being assessed as 2,000 separate projects to skirt need for environmental impact statement.

5. EPA celebrating its Kalamazoo river pipeline spill response.

6. Enbridge setteling with EPA on Kalamazoo river pipeline spill. The most important piece of that settlement is the often quoted $2+ billion pipeline replacement (other safety measures are approximated to amount to $100 million)--which stakeholders have revealed to be a farce!

1. Summary: Rail seems to spill less, but leads to more injuries. Also, more GHG emissions from rail, but in the grand scheme of things (oil industry) it probably does not make too much of a difference.
* [[http://pstrust.org/rail-vs-pipelines/]]

2. Reports seems to suggest that rail is safer than pipeline:
* [[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43390.pdf]]
* [[http://pstrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Intl-Canada-RailAssoc-Oliver_Wyman-Crude_Oil_Transp_Comparing_Safety_Pipelines_Railways-201512.pdf]]

3. Often quoted report by Fraser institute suggests it is less safe, but that is based only on one outlier.

4. This is by the American Petroleum Institut (API)--not comparing, but good data. Also showing absence of trend.
