### Narrative

When the debate on KXL first came up, Nebraska--unlike Montana and South Dakota--[[did not have in place a formal process for deciding on pipeline routes|https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/17265215/state-department-delays-keystone-xl-decision-until-2013]]. Under Nebraska state regulations, KXL did not originally require an environmental impact statement for Nebraska. Assessment of environmental impacts in Nebraska were hence carried out at the federal level by the State Department. Pipeline operators could build, and use eminent domain to acquire right-of-way as they like in Nebraska, since pipelines are considered public infrastructure under Nebraska law. As far as I understand, for the use of eminent domain, an 80% share of the total route has to have been acuiqed. The State Department was involved because KXL crosses the Canada-US border. 

The absense of regulation was a problem for Nebraska. Unlike its "older brother" Keystone, KXL was planned run through the [[Sandhills]]. Nebraska would have no say in the approval process for the pipeline through this sensitive region. [[The State Department eventually decided in November 2011 to delay the decision on the pipeline until 2013 in order to carry out a study on alternative routes.|https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/17265215/state-department-delays-keystone-xl-decision-until-2013]] The legislature and governor of Nebraska were opposed to the route through the sandhills, [[but unlike the environmentalist movement, they were not opposed to the construction of a pipeline through the state or the oil industry in general|https://journalstar.com/news/local/heineman-wants-president-to-deny-pipeline-permit/article_49eeb3fd-b4f1-5e79-99ae-aea09c7757ab.html]]. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, released on August 26, 2011, emphasizes state rights with regard to setting the pipeline route. The State Department expressed this point repeatedly through multiple channels.

As a first reaction, the Governor of Nebraska wrote a letter to the State Department on August 31, calling for the pipeline to be rerouted, but expressing his general support for the pipeline. For some time there were rumors that the Nebraska unicameral legislature would call a special session to exercise their right to determine the pipeline route. Eventually, on October 24, Governor Heineman called a special session, to sit for two weeks starting November 1. TransCanada, wary of the State Departments handling--or rather stalling--of the approval process because of the Sandhills issue supported the special session and the introduction of legislation in Nebraska. The state government of Nebraska was seen as more amicable toward KXL than the State Department, and the Obama administration. Obama at the time ran his reelection campaigna and came under pressure from environmentalists because his environmental record.

The special session of the Nebraska legislature led to an unlikely alliance of Nebraska environmentalists, law makers, and TransCanada in working toward the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act. In parallel, the legislature worked on the Major Pipeline Siting Act for Nebraska. Under the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act, Nebraska would provide funding for an environmental impact assessment for KXL. The decision making power would be placed with the governor--who had previously stated that he supports KXL, but not the current route through the Sandhills. In the following week, the State Department announced a delay of KXL of over a year until 2013, in order to study the alternative routes. TransCanada reacted by agreeing to reroute the pipeline. The following day, the Natural Resource Committee passed an amedment that placed the powers under the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act with the Public Service Commission some sources say in response to TransCanada's agreement to reroute the pipeline. In a meeting with the Natural Resource Committee of the Nebraska legislature, a TransCanada representative encouraged the committee to pass the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act.

The codification of the alternative law was 

To rectify the more general problem--the absense of a formal process--Nebraska introduced law [[LB 1611]] in April of 2012. The majority of Nebraska's unicameral legislature, [[and the governor were critical of the route through the Sandhills, . KXL's new route had already been given the green light by the special session, but LB1611 would apply to future pipelines projects. LB1611 provides a swift process: 

no interest to prevent, just to reroute. push it into next legislature
