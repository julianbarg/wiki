## One-paragraph summary

Ethnografic study on Amway to examine how Amway established its strong ties with its members. The author sampled on an extreme case. Data collection strategies include **semiovert participant observation**, **open-ended interviews**, and **archival data gathering**. Iterative approach to data analysis: move between rich narratives and abstract and analytical level. Starting point: scanning data for dominant themes while collecting data. Modified the framework based on conversations with key informants.
