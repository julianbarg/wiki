## One-paragraph summary
Slawinski and Bansal (2015) build on the paradox literature to suggest that companies might be able to integrate long-term and short-term perspectives. They also borrow from the literature on short-termism to provide an example of previous research discussing intertemporal trade-offs (e.g., criticism of NPV). The purpose of the article is to find out *how* firms attend to intertemporal tensions. Slawinski and Bansal (2015) carried out a conductive case study of five oil sand companies in Alberta to shine light on these mechanisms. They find that two companies polarized, meaning they discussed the long- and short-term separately, while the other three confronted the tension by juxtaposing the time frames. Practices that promote juxtaposition of timeframes include parallel quantitative and qualitative planning, two-way stakeholder engagement, and collaboration with other players in the same or different industries. Parallel quantitative and qualitative planning describes the integration of qualitative information on the deep future alongside quantitative data that is available on the immediate future. In general, the authors find that "firms that emphasized efficiency in their practices polarized the short term and long term and focused primarily on the near-term business implications of climate change [whereas] firms that sought diverse perspectives juxtaposed the short term and long term, thus confronting the intertemporal tension and looking for both short-term and long-term solutions to climate change" (Slawinski and Bansal 2015: 542). Overall, focusing on efficiency brings with it a "temporal myopia" whereas an embrace of diverse perspectives allows for "temporal ambidexterity".
