### Theoretical contribution

The authors endeavour to achieve two objectives with this paper. First, they “take stock”, i.e., conduct a historical overview of sensemaking as a process. Second, they identify two streams of research which would help move this literature on sensemaking “move forward”. As per the authors, this entails not only understanding how sensemaking is accomplished, but also how sensemaking enables other organizational processes. Finally, the authors identify existing tensions and important opportunities that future scholars can build on.

### Taking stock

Sensemaking to begin with is defined as “a process whereby individuals understand novel, unexpected and confusing events”. The authors acknowledge the multiple (at times discrepant) perspectives on sensemaking and clarify as to what they do intend to cover and what they don’t.

Subsequently, they DO state and cover:
* Weickian version of sensemaking
* To some extent, Garfinkel and Gephart’s ethnomethodological approach to sensemaking
* Sensemaking as a process and not necessarily as a theory
* Sensemaking as both retrospective as well as prospective process (Weick, 1995)
* Role of cues
* The socially situated and dynamic/ discursive/ collective nature of cognition

And what they DO NOT cover is:
* They don’t focus on colloquial and synonymous processes like – “trying to understand”, “thinking about” or “socially constructing” issues or situations
* Individual sensemaking (they rather focus on collective sensemaking)
Subsequent to the above discussion, the authors define sensemaking as –a process, prompted by violated expectations, that involves attending to and bracketing cues in the environment, creating intersubjective meaning through cycles of interpretation and action, and thereby enacting a more ordered environment from which further cues can be drawn (p. 67).

Further, they take stock by asking the following three questions (and submitting their responses to the same)


1. How do events triggering sensemaking? Answer: environmental jolts, threats to identity, planned change interventions
2. How is intersubjective meaning constructed? Answer: Actors (leaders) who shape sensemaking in organizations and What actors do (example, leverage narratives which is perceived as “most preferred sensemaking currency”)
3. What is the role of action? Answer: Enactment is key and differentiates sensemaking from interpretation – especially during crises and unexpected events, in temporary organizations and in emerging markets, fields and institutions


Additionally, the author elaborate on - what does sensemaking accomplish? Answer: Sensemaking contributes to the following organizational processes

* Strategic change
* Organizational Learning
* Creativity and Innovation

### Moving forward

After having taken stock of extant literature, the authors submit that moving forward entails - articulating and bridging ontological differences. More specifically it entails answering the following questions:

1. Where does sensemaking reside (individual? collective? institutional?) 
2. When does sensemaking take place (past? present? future?)

The authors further discuss some exciting theoretical opportunities that have emerged vis-à-vis studying sensemaking, i.e., an exploration of the role of power and politics, emotions, embodiment and sociomateriality, distributed processes and institutions in sensemaking.

The authors finally conclude by discussing methodological challenges whilst studying sensemaking which include challenges vis-à-vis collecting nuanced process data, identifying patterns across multiple instances and context, and last but not the least, applying new methods.
