## Actors
* [[TGLO]]
* EPA [[OSC]]
* [[FOSC]]
* [[OPS]]
* [[American Gas Association]] - relevant for population level learning
* American Petroleum Institute ([[API]])
* [[FEMA]]
* [[FWS]]

* [[RSPA]]

## Significance

Drawing attention away from third-party [[Editing San Bernadino train disaster]] and corrosion damage toward "potential catastropic damages to pipelines due to natural disasters" [@NTSB1996 p. 37]. 

Potentially an example of population level learning. Individually, pipeline operators do not know how to handle operating pipelines in flood plains. The [[API]] put forth some temporary standards that showed that they were aware of the issue of flooding, but unfortunately this know-how got "lost" (actually abandoned/"not renewed"). Now, the NTSB puts forth that this knowledge should be anchored at the population level. This is further the first case where I can prove a very different message from the legal system: the DOJ foresaw that the spill would end in an "Act of God" judgement and largely let the corporate perpetrators of the hook, see also [[documents|Houson '94#Regarding-potential-lawsuit]] [@FWS2007 p. 2].

The NTSB report also largely focuses on the flawed response, which led to the smoke injuries of so many people (over 500).

### Learning

#### Mechanisms
* Revelation that rivers are far more unpredictable than previously assumed. Could lead operators to bury their pipelines deeper, and to proactively shutdown and purge their pipelines.
* On the population level, the [[API]] in conjunction with the [[AOPL]] and [[INGAA]] might develop the standards that codify the knowledge gained from this spill.
* Less distance between valves at river crossings, especially where the rivers are threatened by floodings. Possibly installation of remote- or automatic-operated valves.
* [[RSPA]]] issuing a requirement of rapid detection of spills, too. Supposedly through equipment that can remotely detect leaks.

#### Outcomes

* Less oil spills as the result of floodings.
* Lower volume of spills that result from floodings, because of lower distance between valves at river crossings.
* Incidents resulting in lower spill volumes in general, because of of remote- and automatic-operated valves.
* More spills being detected because of remote sensing equipment.

## Summary

In 1994, Hurricane Rosa swept over Texas. It caused heavy rainfall in 38 counties, including a 100-year-flood of the San Jacinto River. On October 19, an LPG pipe by Exxon burst and was subsequently shut down by Exxon staff. On October 20 a Colonial Pipeline pipeline that was still operating burst under the river. The phone call for closing the pipeline was made at ~8:31 AM. It was shut off within two minutes of the call. Some explosions occured and a fire broke out on the river, see [[the spill|Houston '94#The-spill]]. Another Colonial Pipeline pipeline burst at approximately 11:30 AM. That pipeline had been shut off the evening before for reasons unrelated to the flood. The first pipeline to burst contained gasoline, the second contained diesel fuel. Two more pipelines operated by by Texaco (natural gas) and Valero (crude oil) ruptured on October 20. Velero's pipeline had been shut down in August, and some unpressurized crude had remained in the pipeline [@NTSB1996 p. 8].

## The spill

First, the spill only led to a release of oil into the river. Some of the spilled oil engulfed in flames, and explosions occured. See also [[description of fires|Houston '94#initial-leak]].

The response forces decided to use a [[fire boom]] to remove some of the unburned oil [@NTSB1996 p. 14] that had gathered in a flood channel. The plan had the approval of the FOSC and TGLO, [@NTSB1996 pp. 14f]. But the fire was eventually started without approval, because of a miscommunication [@NTSB1996 p. 17]. The fire spread to the main river and burned for approximately 28 hours. Initially, flames stood at 100 feet high, before receding to 60 feet [@NTSB1996 p. 17]. See also [[description of fires|Houston '94#in-situ-burning]].

Because at the time of the accidential start of the controlled fire, some residents had already returned to their home, so there were a relatively high number of residents in the area [@NTSB1996 p. 7]. As a result of the fire and smoke, 547 were injured, including two serious injuries [@NTSB1996 p. 18].

## Cause analysis

### What could have been done

#### To prevent the spill
* Install the pipeline deeper below the river bed in the first place

#### To reduce the severity of the spill

In the case of the Colonial pipeline that was still operating:
* Shutting off the pipeline when the flooding started

In the case of the other spilled pipelines:
* Purging the pipelines ahead of time

Regarding the deployment of the fire boom that led to the high number of smoke injuries:
* Better communication between responders
* Reduction of max workhours per day per responder in emergency situation (to reduce fatigue and make errors such as the accidential start of the fire less likely)

### Faulty parts/flawed procedures
* Pipelines not properly installed below river bed
* No procedures in place for flooding of the river, such as shut off and purging of the pipelines

## Aftermath/learning

## My reactions
* I can't wrap my head around why engineers have not figured out at least until 2011 (see [[documets|Houston '94#Other]]), that river beds can exert great forces on pipelines, even if pipelines are burried a couple of feet deep.
* When all pipelines in Houston are shutoff, this could severely affect the oil price. Might operators be willing to take a rest in order to sell for higher prices?
* "No effective standards or guidance currently exist for designing pipelines that cross flood plains or river crossings" [@NTSB1996 p. 40]. Is that really the standard we hold ourselves to? Whether standards exist or not?
* NTSB document largely comments on response. Because its easier to comment on that? Because its easier to collect data and talk about events?
* When in doubt, the NTSB seems to blame the DOT's RSPA rather than the operators [@NTSB1996 p. 47].

## Various
* "Although pipeline transportation is one of the safest means for transporting petroleum, it poses great risk potential to the environment because of the large volumes of hazardous liquids that can be released when a rupture occurs. In a pipeline transportation situation, there is a greater likelihood of releasing petroleum into environmentally sensitive areas" [@NTSB1996 p. 1].
* Criticises RSPA again [@NTSB1996 p. 42].

### Description of fires

#### Initial leak

> About 9:51 a.m. [on October 20], explosions and fires erupted on the river and began moving slowly southward towards the Interstate 10 bridge. Witnesses reported hearing a series of five distinct explosions and observing balls of fire and smoke rising just north of Interstate 10. After the first explosion, fire and smoke rose about 300–400 feet into the air. A second explosion, located about 200–300 feet to the west of the first, occurred about 10 seconds later, and a third explosion occurred about 600– 700 feet to the west of the second. Minutes later, two more explosions were heard as the fire advanced across the lake and the stream flow carried the petroleum toward the Interstate 10 bridge [@NTSB1996 p. 6].

#### In-situ burning

> The resulting fire [which was ignited on October 23, 6:03 PM], sent flames about 100 feet into the air. The smoke plume rose about 1,500 feet vertically and, when it came into contact with an inversion layer, the smoke traveled horizontally. [...] By 9:00 p.m. on October 23, the height of the flames from the in-situ fire had reduced to 60 feet. By 6:00 a.m. the next day, the fire was moving south, away from the new channel. The Coast Guard monitored the progress of the fire, and the EPA assessed the airborne pollution threat until the fire self-extinguished about 10:00 p.m. on October 24. [@NTSB1996 p. 17].

### Erroneous start of in-situ burning

> One of the EPA contract employees left on the east side of the fire boom stated that while the EPA OSC and the Colonial safety coordinator were on the west bank of the new channel discussing the proposed in-situ controlled burn, he and the others heard the question “What are you waiting for?,” over the EPA contractor’s mobile radio. The EPA contract employee stated that the east bank team believed that the question signaled them to ignite the accumulated petroleum products. He stated that he tried three times unsuccessfully to make radio contact to confirm that the product should be ignited. Then, the three employees on the east bank agreed that they had been signaled to ignite the accumulated products. Flares were lit, placed on a trashcan lid, and floated into the area of accumulated petroleum products adjacent to the fire boom [@NTSB1996 p. 17].

### Pipeline damages and learning

> Damages --Thirty-seven of the 69 pipelines that cross the flood plain were either ruptured or undermined during the flood; 13 at river crossings only, 18 at locations within the flood plain not at crossings, and 6 in both locations. Eight of the 69 pipelines ruptured during the flood; 4 at river crossings and 4 in the flood plain. Only 12 of the 25 operators that provided information on the design bases of their pipelines indicated that they had performed some type of study of the river crossing to augment their design decisions. (Survey responses did not include details on the types of studies performed.) The other 13 operators cited industry codes, Federal regulations, or both as the bases of their pipeline designs. No operator indicated that it had used the American Petroleum Institute’s Bulletin 1105, Bulletin on Construction for Oil and Products Pipe Lines (first edition, 1955) or performed a comprehensive study of the flood plain. Spill [@NTSB1996 p. 25]

### Lack of response

> On learning of the failures, a few operators elected to shut operations, down but left products under pressure and valves open in the shutdown pipelines. Some shut down operations, closed valves, and purged the pipelines of products. One operator continued operations for a time, but posted employees at valves near the river crossing to be prepared to close them should a
rupture occur. Other operators continued operations as usual, though they were aware of several failures of pipelines across the San Jacinto flood plain. The Safety Board concludes that most operators of pipelines crossing the San Jacinto River flood plain continued operations without evaluating the capability of the pipeline design to withstand the threats presented by the flood [@NTSB1996 p. 41].

## Notes
* "For those stations where the 100- year-flood was exceeded, the flood was from 1.1 to 2.9 times the 100-year-flood" [@NTSB1996 p. 2].
* The floods began on October 14 [@NTSB1996 p. 2]. The first pipeline spill did not occur until October 19.
* The Colonial Pipeline spill occured at 8:31 AM  on Oct 20, the county communications center did not learn about this spill until 9:41 AM from a concerned citizen [@NTSB1996 pp. 5f].
* Mean to cancel in-situ burning, but did not communicate this decision [@NTSB1996 p. 16].
* Eventual fire was started because of miscommunication, see [[erroneous ignition|Houston '94#Erroneous-start-of-in-situ-burning]].
* Not all operators sustained damages to their pipelines--Exxon emptied a pipelines on October 19 [@NTSB1996 p. 18].
* Fire departments did not attempt to extinguish any fires on the rived [@NTSB1996 p. 19]
* The coast guard had previously (in February) carried out an excercise for just the kind of fire that occured. The drill identified communication issues [@NTSB1996 p. 20].
* Near miss or failure redefined as success: "The FOSC stated that, because no one was injured and the burn was technically effective and the 'right thing to do,' he did not aggressively pursue the matter" [@NTSB1996 p. 21].
* [The OPA] stated that the EPA OSC requested and received permission from the FOSC to conduct an in-situ burn, and that about 7:00 p.m. (actual time was about 6:00 p.m.), the in-situ burn was initiated. The EPA reported that the burn lasted about 2 hours (actual duration was about 28 hours), was monitored throughout, self- extinguished, and affected about 0.25 acre (actually more than 15 acres) [@NTSB1996 p. 22].
* "Erosive forces during periods of high water flow may have a capacity as much as 100 times greater than those acting during periods of intermediate or low flow" [@NTSB1996 p. 24].
* Shutdown and purging of the pipeline proceeded in vastly diverging fashion across operators [@NTSB1996 p. 27].
* Design requirements obviously unsuitable for withstanding 100-year floods. Yet, in an earlier section used this law to justify their action (claim that pipelines comply with regulations) [@NTSB1996 p. 32].
* Operators response plan starting point is occurance and awareness of a spill, rather than threat of a spill [@NTSB1996 p. 33].
* In 1969, industry showed an awareness of rivers changing their beds [@NTSB1996 p. 33].
* RSPA promoting new rules on leak detection [@NTSB1996 p. 36].
* Pipeline design of most operators showed no consideration for flooding [@NTSB1996 p. 39].
* A document by the [[API]] existed that addressed the root cause (API Bulleting 1105), but it was abandoned.
* Plans were inadequate [@NTSB1996 p. 41], yet operators would have been able to use an act of god defense [FWS2007 p. 2]?!
* Colonial messed up by not closing their pipeline [@NTSB1996 p. 42].
* Suggests technological solution: "operational monitoring and [...] remote-or automatic-operated valves" [@NTSB1996 p. 42].
* Critique of in-situ burning, but also support for the decision in general [@NTSB1996 pp. 43f].
