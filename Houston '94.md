## My reactions
* I can't wrap my head around why engineers have not figured out at least until 2011 (see [[documets|Houston '94#Other]]), that river beds can exert great forces on pipelines, even if pipelines are burried a couple of feet deep.

## Various
* "Although pipeline transportation is one of the safest means for transporting petroleum, it poses great risk potential to the environment because of the large volumes of hazardous liquids that can be released when a rupture occurs. In a pipeline transportation situation, there is a greater likelihood of releasing petroleum into environmentally sensitive areas" [@NTSB1996 p. 1].

### Description of fires

Initial leak:

> About 9:51 a.m. [on October 20], explosions and fires erupted on the river and began moving slowly southward towards the Interstate 10 bridge. Witnesses reported hearing a series of five distinct explosions and observing balls of fire and smoke rising just north of Interstate 10. After the first explosion, fire and smoke rose about 300–400 feet into the air. A second explosion, located about 200–300 feet to the west of the first, occurred about 10 seconds later, and a third explosion occurred about 600– 700 feet to the west of the second. Minutes later, two more explosions were heard as the fire advanced across the lake and the stream flow carried the petroleum toward the Interstate 10 bridge [@NTSB1996 p. 6].

In-situ burning:

> The resulting fire sent flames about 100 feet into the air. The smoke plume rose about 1,500 feet vertically and, when it came into contact with an inversion layer, the smoke traveled horizontally [@NTSB1996 p. 17].

### Erroneous start of in-situ burning

> One of the EPA contract employees left on the east side of the fire boom stated that while the EPA OSC and the Colonial safety coordinator were on the west bank of the new channel discussing the proposed in-situ controlled burn, he and the others heard the question “What are you waiting for?,” over the EPA contractor’s mobile radio. The EPA contract employee stated that the east bank team believed that the question signaled them to ignite the accumulated petroleum products. He stated that he tried three times unsuccessfully to make radio contact to confirm that the product should be ignited. Then, the three employees on the east bank agreed that they had been signaled to ignite the accumulated products. Flares were lit, placed on a trashcan lid, and floated into the area of accumulated petroleum products adjacent to the fire boom [@NTSB1996 p. 17].

## Notes
* "For those stations where the 100- year-flood was exceeded, the flood was from 1.1 to 2.9 times the 100-year-flood" [@NTSB1996 p. 2].
* The floods began on October 14 [@NTSB1996 p. 2]. The first pipeline spill did not occur until October 19.
* The Colonial Pipeline spill occured at 8:31 AM  on Oct 20, the county communications center did not learn about this spill until 9:41 AM from a concerned citizen [@NTSB1996 pp. 5f].
* Mean to cancel in-situ burning, but did not communicate this decision [@NTSB1996 p. 16].
* Eventual fire was started because of miscommunication, see [[erroneous ignition|Houston '94#Erroneous-start-of-in-situ-burning]].
