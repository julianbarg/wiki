## Aftermath/learning

## My reactions
* I can't wrap my head around why engineers have not figured out at least until 2011 (see [[documets|Houston '94#Other]]), that river beds can exert great forces on pipelines, even if pipelines are burried a couple of feet deep.

## Various
* "Although pipeline transportation is one of the safest means for transporting petroleum, it poses great risk potential to the environment because of the large volumes of hazardous liquids that can be released when a rupture occurs. In a pipeline transportation situation, there is a greater likelihood of releasing petroleum into environmentally sensitive areas" [@NTSB1996 p. 1].

## Notes
* "For those stations where the 100- year-flood was exceeded, the flood was from 1.1 to 2.9 times the 100-year-flood" [@NTSB1996 p. 2].
* The floods began on October 14 [@NTSB1996 p. 2]. The first pipeline spill did not occur until October 19.
* The Colonial Pipeline spill occured at 8:31 AM  on Oct 20, the county communications center did not learn about this spill until 9:41 AM from a concerned citizen [@NTSB1996 pp. 5f].
