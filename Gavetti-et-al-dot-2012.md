## One-paragraph summary

The original premise of [[BTOF]] is that decision making is central to behavioral theory, and therefore BTOF should be based on the logic and psychology of human choice (ibid., 3). Concretely, (1) humans satisfice instead of maximize, (2) they engage in search only under certain circumstances, and (3) their behavior in organizations is often guided by "*[r]ules,standard operating procedures, and status quo*" (ibid., 5; emphasis in original). Among the four central "relational concepts" of Cyert and March (1963) is *learning* (the others are (1) quasi-resolution of conflict, (2) uncertainty avoidance, and (3) problematistic search). There are six reserach themes on BTOF right
