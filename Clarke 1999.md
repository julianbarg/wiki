### Chapter 1: Creating Risks

How internal factors determine perception of (acceptable) risk.

### Chapter 2: Organizational Chaos

Discussion of whether or not OGS was aware of the danger present in the State Office Building (SOB) that was to be cleaned after a fire. Answer--probably not initially; lower organizational levels were aware of the toxic chemical compound, but decisions makers had no way of knowing that it was present in the soot that was being cleaned up. Two other factors are that (1) responsibility or right of the involved organizations to deal with the incident are non-obvious (garbage can model), and (2) from a medical and scientific perspective, the facts were quite unclear. Clarke rejects the use of a rational model of decision making (or the callous-bureaucracy theory) to analyze this case.

### Chapter 3: Constricting the Field of Organizations

Explains the politics of which agencies got involved. Which actors should or should not have been involved is not immediately obvious--Clarke lists 11 organizations that could have gotten involved, but did not. The remaining three organizations then negotiated solutions. The other organizations that did not get involved represent a repository for alternative solutions.

### Chapter 4: An Excursus on Resolving Organizational Dilemmas

Juxtaposes the theory of how decisions on assuming risks are made with the actual decision making process. The document that was eventually produced to open the garage seems to have been produced with that purpose in mind--despite the fact that relatively little was known about the involved chemicals and their interactions at the time. How can formal risk assessment be carried out in an area full of unknowns? An official not in favor of the decision to open the garage had to be removed to enable this decision to come to fruition. An important driving force of consulting experts was to reduce liability. Acceptable levels of the chemicals were not defined before testing (the actors were hoping for unambiguous results). Defining those acceptable levels then was a political process.

### Chapter 5: Organizing Medical Surveillance

Describes how medical surveillance was constructed in an interorganizational context. Once the DOH took control of the situation--the important resources (see resource-based view)--it defined procedures. The procedures are not below the initial expectations, but DOH employees did not believe in the dangers of the substances, which probably explains this outcome.
