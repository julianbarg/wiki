### Chapter 1: Some Functions of Planning

(1) Planning is rhetorical. (2) Planning is an undertaking of organizations. For instance, only organizations like the coast guard can mobilize the incredible responses that are utilized in spill response. Or also self-similarity: organizations can "splinter", e.g., form sub-units, and those sub-units will look alike. And organizations have complex memory--"stories, memos, official histories, and institutionalized patterns of behavior" (p. 7). In case of complex disasters, planning is more an excercise in appearing rational, and therefore legitimate, though. (3) Organizations, in the case of complex challenges, do not know what matters (I guess). Therefore, there are some limits to planning. (4) Laying out the difference between risk and uncertainty. "[R]isk is when you know the possible range of things that may happen following a choice; uncertainty is when you don't" (p. 11). Organizations attempt to translate uncertainties into risk. Distinguishes between operational utility (rational planning) and symbolic utility. (5) Lots of stuff? Planning is political?! "[S]ymbolic plans, which I call fantasy docuemnts, are rhetocial instruments that have poltical utility in reducing uncertainty for organizations and experts" (p. 13). These "fantasy documents" are mostly there to categorize problems, assign them to existing structure (and thus indicate who might be in charge of an evolving situation).

### Chapter 2: Fantasy Documents

Some examples of excercises and how they expose the flaws of fantasy documents. "[Fantasy documents" are tested against reality only rarely" (p. 30). "An important part of the story I want to tell has to do with how people and organizations become so certain they know what the future will entail" (p. 40). "The fantasies can lead people working within high-risk orgnaizations to be overconfident that their procedures are strong enough to prevent system breakdown; and they can lead people outside organizations to believe promises that their interests are protected" (p. 42).

### Chapter 3: Planning and the C-Shibboleths

Communication, cooperation, coordination. "Often enough, planning and success *do not* coincide, but are loosely connected or even decoupled" (p. 57; emphasis in original). Important keyword: worst case scenario. "[C]orrespondence between plans and successful response is often illusory. That correspondence is often more something we'd *like* to believe is there than something real. For to admit the observe--that planning may have little to do with successful evacuation--is unnerving at best and at worst undermines the main supporting beam of Western rationalism: control based on expert knowledge" (pp. 68f; emphasis in original).

### Chapter 4: Apparent Affinities

We have to have plans, because it would be unthinkable just to respond "we cannot plan for that" (p. 71). Instead, organizations reach for affinities and try to turn them into God-terms that are accepted by outsiders (and insiders) without questioning (p. 73). The plan for Alaska oil recovery was to recover 95% of oil spilled (p. 79).
