### Chapter 1: Creating Risks

How internal factors determine perception of (acceptable) risk.

### Chapter 2: Organizational Chaos

Discussion of whether or not OGS was aware of the danger present in the State Office Building (SOB) that was to be cleaned after a fire. Answer--probably not initially; lower organizational levels were aware of the toxic chemical compound, but decisions makers had no way of knowing that it was present in the soot that was being cleaned up. Two other factors are that (1) responsibility or right of the involved organizations to deal with the incident are non-obvious (garbage can model), and (2) from a medical and scientific perspective, the facts were quite unclear. Clarke rejects the use of a rational model of decision making (or the callous-bureaucracy theory) to analyze this case.

### Chapter 3: Constricting the Field of Organizations

Explains the politics of which agencies got involved. Which actors should or should not have been involved is not immediately obvious--Clarke lists 11 organizations that could have gotten involved, but did not. The remaining three organizations then negotiated solutions. The other organizations that did not get involved represent a repository for alternative solutions.

### Chapter 4: An Excursus on Resolving Organizational Dilemmas

Juxtaposes the theory of how decisions on assuming risks are made with the actual decision making process. The document that was eventually produced to open the garage seems to have been produced with that purpose in mind--despite the fact that relatively little was known about the involved chemicals and their interactions at the time. How can formal risk assessment be carried out in an area full of unknowns? An official not in favor of the decision to open the garage had to be removed to enable this decision to come to fruition. An important driving force of consulting experts was to reduce liability. Acceptable levels of the chemicals were not defined before testing (the actors were hoping for unambiguous results). Defining those acceptable levels then was a political process.

### Chapter 5: Organizing Medical Surveillance

Describes how medical surveillance was constructed in an interorganizational context. Once the DOH took control of the situation--the important resources (see resource-based view)--it defined procedures. The procedures are not below the initial expectations, but DOH employees did not believe in the dangers of the substances, which probably explains this outcome.

### Chapter 6: Organizing Decontamination

Laying out the plan to "tire out" the public and scientific community. Disillusion has given way to a management approach that seeks to bring the debate to an end by not engaging its counterparts, since a final answer cannot be found. Why the action (of decontamination) had to be carried out? Clarke argues that there is escalation of commitment (p. 136).

Overall, this is how a solution came to be: the process was streamlined through the creation of a dedicated agency (VERSAR). Before the many voices with diverging interests prevented the emergence of a consensus. That new entitity then pushed the process through by preventing public debate and artificially limiting the number of options to be discussed by experts. (Maybe that was because some options were considered to be unreasonable and not to be considered by VERSAR? Malice is not necessarily the reason.)

## Important points

* "Implicit in all these pronouncements was the unfailing faith that the SOB could be cleaned, that it *must* be cleaned and reopened, and that the notion of taking the building apart and carting it away was ludicrous" (p. 133, emphasis in original).
* "I am suggesting that a process of commitment to a course of action occurred, wherein promises made or implied without knowing how those promises would be filfilled. If organizations say loudly enough and long enough that they are going to do something, they can create a situation in which that action *must* follow their proclamations" (p. 136, emphasis in original).
