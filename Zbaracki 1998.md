## One-page summary

### Theoretical underpinnings and contribution
How do institutional forces shape the reality of a particular technical program (more specifically Total Quality Management – TQM)? Simultaneously, how do individual actions and rhetoric shape institutional forces?  The author endeavours to answer these questions by leveraging an inductive, qualitative methodology using case studies for theory building. This study was conducted during the heydays of TQM (and other similar management programs like just-in-time manufacturing - JIT, business process reengineering - BPR, etc.) in the early-mid 90s.  In some sense TQM is an exemplar for any management fad and the author attempts to make sense between the disconnect and interactions between the concrete/ unambiguous aspects of a program (the technical/ statistical techniques) and the ambiguous understanding and practice of the same. 

More specifically the author addresses a particular gap in institutional theory which would suggest that during later stages of a program intervention, a standard stripped down, symbolic version of a program would be leveraged for the purposes of gaining legitimacy. The author argues that it is not so in the case of TQM and somehow the collective efforts have “expanded, rather than contracted, the definition of TQM”. Further, the author notes that institutional theory had not thus far (until the mid-90s) shed light on the underlying processes and forces. The author endeavours to address these gaps by banking on a socially constructed view of reality (Berger and Luckmann, 1966) and applies the same to understand the underlying processes, forces and actions which help shape the social reality of what can be understood as an “institution” of TQM. 

### Methods
Given the specific focus on understanding the underlying processes, forces and actions which help shape both the rhetoric (what they say) and reality (what they do) of TQM, the author uses theoretical sampling and identifies a diverse set of five case studies (more specifically, a defense contractor, a hotel, a hospital, manufacturing and a govt agency). In terms of data collection, the author attempts triangulation by leveraging interviews (69 semi-structure interviews), literature on TQM philosophy and statistical techniques, organizational documents and his own observations (including observations as a participant of a TQM training program). 

Data analysis focused on two themes of the author’s stated interest – the rhetoric (what people said about TQM) and the reality (what people actually did). And throughout the process, the author continued to iterate between theory (deductive analysis) and data (inductive analysis). In terms of theoretical lens, at some point of time during the data analysis, the author decided to leverage an evolutionary perspective for further analysis and theory building. 

### Findings and limitations
Given that the goal of the study was theory building, what emerged at the end of the iterative analysis was an evolutionary model of rhetoric and reality. The model assumes individual agency by organizational members in terms specific selection of elements related to both the rhetoric of TQM and the reality of TQM. Further, the author claims that this assumption is consistent with institutional theory by citing Scott (1995). Also, this assumption is validated by observations on the ground which show that individual organizational members socially construct their own models of TQM by agent-ically selecting from both the rhetorical elements of TQM as well as the technical/ reality elements of TQM. Organizational structures, the author finds, are thus engineered (a la Perrow’s “tool view”). 

Further, the author’s model has two major components. Firstly, the evolutionary component which traces the trajectory of the entry of TQM into an organization and how it interacts with the organization’s reality (day to day activities) to shape (and be shaped) and change the organization. The author finds that this happens in nested and repeated cycles of variation, selection and retention. And secondly, the combined rhetoric + reality component. The author’s model thus helps appreciate the various forces (both for and against) that shape the emerging rhetoric and reality of TQM within the organizations studied. 

One thing which I was not completely clear about - the author mentions that at one “critical point” during the data analysis, he took the decision to use an evolutionary lens (page 611). There is however very little elaboration on this choice. What would have helped the reader appreciate the author’s rationale better would be some more details behind the rationale for this choice (as against other possible alternatives like the garbage can model or the power/ politics model, etc.).
