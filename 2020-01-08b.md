* Drawing connection to [[Resource-based View]] and [[Dynamic Capabilities]]
* I could tell a story of the different pathways that are available for a firm, under public pressure. To be e frontrunner or freeloader. To be a frontrunner has the advantage of attaining knowledge first, the issue being that the value of the knowledge is not yet known. It is also possible that the knowledge can be acquired at a later point in time at a significantly lower price. But if the knowledge is more tacit in nature, being a frontrunner can also result in a great payoff. In the case of environmental sustainability, outside stakeholders may punish any later adapters, seemingly at random. Or, when these onlookers cannot differentiate between the performance of different organizations in the population, they may punish all organizations, regardless of their previous efforts.
