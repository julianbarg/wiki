* What is the role/importance of resource commitments?
* Can I talk about the environment without talking about institutions (as in "Institutional Theory")
* Drawing connection to [[Resource-based View]] and [[Dynamic Capabilities]]
* I could tell a story of the different pathways that are available for a firm, under public pressure. To be e frontrunner or freeloader. To be a frontrunner has the advantage of attaining knowledge first, the issue being that the value of the knowledge is not yet known. It is also possible that the knowledge can be acquired at a later point in time at a significantly lower price. But if the knowledge is more tacit in nature, being a frontrunner can also result in a great payoff. In the case of environmental sustainability, outside stakeholders may punish any later adapters, seemingly at random. Or, when these onlookers cannot differentiate between the performance of different organizations in the population, they may punish all organizations, regardless of their previous efforts.
* Could [[Learning]] (in the Marchian sense) be set up as a population-level counterpart to [[Dynamic Capabilities]]? Dynamic Capabilities: some organizations have capabilities that allow them adjust to a changing environment, the most frequently mentioned one being knowledge acquisition. In the (new) learning literature, we are zooming out, and we are taking a more critical look at the same time. Industries are in constant flux, and organizations suffer from knowledge depreciation. Expectations that the organizations have to meet are in flux also. Organizations pick and choose targets of learning acquisitions, and they have diverging abilities to meet their learning targets. The knowledge that is "floating around" also has diverging attributes. It may be more suitable to meet short-term or long-term goals, whereas organizations have diverging preferences (degrees of myopia; ([[Miner and Anderson 1999]]). The knowledge is also optimized toward diverging goals, such as symbolic vs substantive compliance ([[Wijen 2014]]). On the one hand, organizations pick and choose the knowledge they (attempt to) adopt, on the other hand, because (individuals' and by extention organizations') search mechanisms are imperfect, they also look for other organizations for orientation. Altogether, we arrive at a mechanism that allows for diversity, but also coherence in a population, depending on environmental parameters such as coherence in expectations from stakeholders.
* Would there be benefits to distinguishing between optimizing (clear input-output relationship) and learning (qualitative change in knowledge structure)?
* There may exist multiple viable solutions to the same problem (related to ibid., 9-12).
* New problem statement: we can explain organizational and group performance somewhat well, but not population performance.

## Response to [[Greve 1999]]
* What is the purpose of defining learning as having possible upsides/downsides, being positive/negative over different periods of time, if we do not model this, if we do not take this serious for empirics?
* Learning literature provides me with a neat dual standing. On the one hand, everybody agrees that doing the same thing, but more efficiently is better (e.g., same activity, less pollution). My other hat is that we are suffering from catastrophic environmental damage, so why even care about firms. Not sure where I was going with this, I think there was a more profound point somewhere. 
* Transfer of inappropriate routines.

## Response to [[Miner et al 1999]]
* One of the classic learning from failure stories.
* Now I get it. Population-level learning is the business literature representation of regulations.
* Some business models exist only in some countries, not in others. WeChat exists in China, not in the US, although all of the parts are there, and regularly copies features from WeChat yet has not picked up on things like payment. This suggests that population-level learning is highly situational, and that companies can truly learn the wrong lessons.

## Response to [[Lant and Phelps 1999]]
* Social learning, and cognition, again.
