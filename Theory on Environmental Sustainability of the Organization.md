Systemic problem, but empirical research & theories of limited scale.

## Description

Strategy scholarship, because of its traditional focus on profitibility as an outcome, generally features a narrow scope of very strict, econometric research. The standards for publishing in the area is generally high, because of a general (justified) concern regarding the selection on the dependent variable. For instance, variance decomposition.

### Interdisciplinary theories

### Goal & optimizing 

## Three approaches

2. Explain how environmental sustainability could come about (high barrier)
3. Explain why current model fails
