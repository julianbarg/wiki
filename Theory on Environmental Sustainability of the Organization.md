## Disconnect between theories

Systemic problem, but empirical research & theories of limited scale.

## Description

Strategy scholarship, because of its traditional focus on profitibility as an outcome, generally features a narrow scope of very strict, econometric research. The standards for publishing in the area is generally high, because of a general (justified) concern regarding the selection on the dependent variable. Findings are generally quite general and high level.

Sustainability research, outside the area of strategy scholarship, is usually concerned with 

Variance decomposition might be an empirical strategy. If its just correlation, and not causation, that is still a meaningful outcome, we just need to be wise with how to use that knowledge. E.g., if private companies generally do worse because they are bigger--if we obtain their overall profiles (similar to fsqca), that is still helpful.

### Interdisciplinary theories

* [[Planetary boundaries]]

### Goal & optimizing 

## Three approaches

1. Theories on environmental carrying capacity
2. Explain how environmental sustainability could come about (high barrier)
3. Explain why current model fails

## Learning from other disciplines

* Specific types of organizations instead of generalized models
* Industry trends rather than universal trends
* Hot spots rather than universal observations

## Literatures
* [[Planetary boundaries]]
* [[Radical theory]] (Bobby Banerjee)
* [[Extant empirical papers]]
