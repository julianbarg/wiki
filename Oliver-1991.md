## One-page summary
Main purpose of the article: 1) identify different strategic responses that organizations enact as a result of the institutional pressure to conform 2) combines institutional theory and resource dependence view to show that firms do not blindly succumb to isomorphic pressures.

* Power lies within institutional environment (IT) vs. within organization (RD)
