## Cases

* Mask wearing
    * Mask wearing is a great example of reliability on different levels. The science on mask wearing is conclusive and long-established--think doctors wearing masks when dealing with infectious diseases. Internationally, mask wearing is relatively well accepted. However, if our level of analysis was Florida, we would speak of a low reliability/high validity situation.
* EPA study of Keystone XL impact
        * The original State Department study of Keystone XL found a negligable environmental impact on global climate. Because transportation cost overall were a negligale factor, the oil would find its way to the market one way or another. Tnergy prices fell and this revealed that transportation cost were more impactful than originally thought. The original situation was revealed to be a low validity/high reliability situation (although there have always been indivuals and groups who challenged the original logic).
