## Cases

* Mask wearing & vaccine passports
    * Mask wearing is a great example of reliability on different levels. The science on mask wearing is conclusive and long-established--think doctors wearing masks when dealing with infectious diseases. Internationally, mask wearing is relatively well accepted. However, if our level of analysis was Florida, we would speak of a low reliability/high validity situation.
    * Vaccine pasports highlight the temporal dimension or reliability. In times of great international pandemics--before there were vaccines against diseases such as Polio--the iconic _Yellow Card_ became widely recognized and accepted. Although our (codified) knowledge on how the vaccine passport works has of course been preserved, the anti-vaccine movement has slightly eroded the reliability of this knowledge. This has allowed for the anti-lockdownprotests in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the basis of invalid and unreliable knowledge.
* EPA study of Keystone XL impact
    * The original State Department study of Keystone XL found a negligable environmental impact on global climate. Because transportation cost overall were a negligale factor, the oil would find its way to the market one way or another. Tnergy prices fell and this revealed that transportation cost were more impactful than originally thought. The original situation was revealed to be a low validity/high reliability situation (although there have always been indivuals and groups who challenged the original logic).
