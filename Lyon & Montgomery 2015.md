* Back to [[Greenwashing]]

[[_TOC_]]

## One-paragraph summary

There are different theories that could explain greenwashing. Organizational theory suggests that decoupling could be a mechanis. Signaling or marketing could be a motivation. The literature on greenwashing has identified three drivers of greenwashing: the external ([[Table 4|Lyon & Montgomery 2015.md#table-4-drivers-of-corporate-greenwashing]]), organizational, and individal level. Lyon & Montgomery suggest that (at least) six varities of greenwashing exist: (1) selective disclosure, (2) emtpty green claims and policies, (3) dubious certifications and labels, (4) co-opted NGO endorsements/partnerships, (5) ineffective public voluntary programs, (5) misleading narrative and discourse, and (6) misleading visual imagery.
