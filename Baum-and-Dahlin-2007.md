## Important points
* Emphasizes difference between learning and learning curve literature (ibid., 368).
* *Exploitation* is why failure matters - it causes companies to move to exploration (ibid., 369).
* Four main variables: operating experience, failures, both own and vicarious.
* Also includes measure for decay.
* Historical aspiration: generated by fitting an additional variable $\alpha$ to performance and aspiration at $t-1$.
* Social aspiration: average performance in the sample in that year.
* Also includes accident heterogeneity.

## One-paragraph summary
Organizations learn from their own experience when performance is near aspiration, and from others' experience, when performance falls short of aspiration. Argues that railroads bear some characteristics of HROs (p. 369). For aspiration, considers both historical performance and social performance relative to peers to the peer or reference group. Provides fairly extensive review of aspirations literature.
