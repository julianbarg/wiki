# @Hoffman2015

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]], [[Constructivism & Ecology]]_

## One-sentence summary

@Hoffman2015 provide an introduction to the literature on the anthropocene and a research agenda for scholars on institutional theory. Their suggestion is for scholars to focus on anomalous events, field-level constituency--that is, the community of shared values and belief that constitutes for instance an industry--, social movements and institutional entrepreneurship, and dependencies and discourse of change. Many sections of the article are also spend on normative analyses of the anthropocene and our societies (present and future) response. The conclusion section is by far the strongest, as the authors call for the O&NE community to return to their roots and give voice to more radical ideas again, contra "'the business case' for action" [@Hoffman2015,p. 25].
