_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

## One-sentence summary

The authors criticise the 'sustainability as a journey' metaphor. They argue that companies applying the metaphor can escape legitimate criticism. The language is that of engagement without being specifying the details.

> The journey metaphor translates sustainability (and sustainable development) into a never-ending process privileging the search for technical consensus. Through adopting an infinite process approach implying progress over time, companies can continue to defer addressing key moral issues: limited resource availability; finite substitution possibilities; a lack of connectedness and our collective peril; and no special place for the environment at all. The concept of sustainability is being defined in ways that largely permit business-as-not-too-unusual; a strategy that preserves ‘unsustainability’ [@Milne2006, 825].
