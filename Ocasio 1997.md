## One-paragraph summary
Ocasio (1997) attempts a major revision or clarification of the [[Behavioral Theory]] of the firm by building on [[Simon 1947]]. He takes serious the "limited attentional capabilities of humans" (Ocasio 1997: 188), and develops a formal model of all elements of attention that - determined by the decision-maker's focus, situatedness, and the structural distribution of attention in the organization. Ocasio (1997) holds that these elements of attention determine organizational behavior.

## One-page summary
The author realizes that the focus on attention in Simon’s (1947) work on administrative behavior was lost and that it deserves more attention. He then proposes the Attention-based view of the firm by arguing that that firm behavior is the result of how firms channel and distribute the attention of their decision makers. The main argument can be divided into three principles: 

1. Focus of attention: What decision-makers do depends on what issues and answers they focus on their attention on.  
2. Situated Attention: What issues and answers they focus on and what they do depends on the particular context or situation they find themselves in.  
3. Structural Distribution of Attention: Particular context or situation decision makers find themselves in, and how they attend to it depends on how the firm’s rules, resources, and social relationships regulate and control the distribution and allocation of issues, answers, and decision-makers into specific activities, communications, and procedures (Ocasio, 1997, pg.188). 

In the paper, attention is defined to ‘encompass the noticing, encoding, interpreting, and focusing of time and effort by organizational decision-makers on both a) issues and b) answers’ (pg. 189). What distinguishes this perspective from other perspectives on organizational cognition is that while other views focus on shared cognition of organizational members or the top management team, this view focuses on the relationships between individual and organizational-level information processing. The author emphasizes this point by highlighting that the above three principles each function at different level of analysis, with focus of attention operating at the level of individual cognition, situated attention operating at the level of social cognition, and structural distribution of attention operating at the organizational level. 

Finally, the author further develops the model by suggesting possible mechanisms underlying different areas of the framework as outlined below: 

### Environment of Decision 
(1a) Environmental Stimuli – in any specific communication or procedural channel, physical, economic, and institutional factors both external and internal to the firm impinge upon the environment of decision and provide a set of stimuli for decision-making 

(1b) Cultural and institutional tool kids- cultural and institutional processes provide decision makers with a repertoire or tool kit of issues and answers 

(1c) environmental embeddedness – firm’s rules, resources, and social relationships are embedded in and shaped by, the firm’s economic, social, and institutional environment 

### Issues and Answers 
(2) embodiment of issues and answers – issues and answers are embodied in the cultural products and artifacts used to construct the firm’s activities and communications 

### Procedural and Communication Channels 
(3) Availability and saliency of issues and answers – the spatial, temporal, and procedural dimensions of the firm’s communication ad procedural channels affect the availability and saliency of issues and answers that decision-makers will attend to 

### Attention Structures 
(4a) The valuation of issues and answers – the firm’s attention structures govern the valuation and legitimization of the repertoire of issues and answers available to decision-makers. These values are not uniform throughout the firm but are differentiated according to the division of labor inherent in the firm’s rules, positions, players, and resources 

(4b) The channeling of decision-making – the firm’s attention structures channel and distribute the decision-making activities of the firm into a set of procedural and communication channels 

(4c) The structuring of interests and identities – the firm’s attention structures provide decision-makers with a structured system of interest and identities to motivate their action and to structure their decision premises 

### Decision-makers 
(5a) The structuring of participation – decision-making is the product of interactions among participants in the firm’s procedural and action channels. The structuring of participation is, in turn, conditional on the time, energy, interests, and identities of organisational decision-makers, and on the demands placed on decision-makers by alternative channels.  

(5b) Enactment of issues ad answers – Decision-makers will enact the environment of decision by focusing their attention on limited number of issues of answers. This attentional focus is shaped both by characteristics of the situation and by the structural determinants of attention 

(5c) Selection of Organizational Moves – Decision-makers will select among alternative organizational moves depending on which issues and answers they attend to. The attention to issues and answers results both from passive response to environmental stimuli and preparatory attention and effort and will vary depending on the procedural and communication channel where decision-making is situated 

### Organizational Moves 
(6) Effects on subsequent moves – Organizational moves, once enacted, become part of the firm’s environment of decision and are inputs to the construction of subsequent organizational moves
