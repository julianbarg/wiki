# Springett2003

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

* Based on interviews/focus groups/workshops with business leaders in New Zealand

## One-paragraph summary

Springett finds that the language surrounding sustainability in New Zealand is dominated by conservative approaches. More progressive concepts, such as criticism of consumption and 'creation of needs' (Habermas 1971 via Springett 2003) do not appear. Overall, sustainable development has become synonymous with eco-modernism, and more radical approaches are silenced.

> Radicalization of the discourse has not yet taken place: what we have in the main is a certain amount of fervour in some companies for an eco-modernist approach that is based on the weak end of the continumm of positions, and the possibility that a more radical shift will be inhibited by the control exercised by the 'sustainable development' industry and conservative sceptics.
