## Important points

### Insight 1: From Independent Pillars to Inseparable Complex Social-Ecological Systems

* Foundation: three-pillared notion, where the three pillars have to be understood as inseparable (p. 270). System cannot be reduced to its components for analysis, but has to be understood in its entity.
* Suggested measures: policy interventions, targets, and adaptive managemente (p. 261).

### Insight 2: From Local to Cross-Scale Dynamics

* Telecoupling: coupling between subsystems across a distance. 

### Insight 3: From Incremental Change to Systemic Tipping Points and Shifts

* "the potential for systemic reorganizationmaybe thenormrather than the exception in complex SES" (p. 275).

### Insight 4: From Adapting to Change to Transforming for Change Sustainable

* **Incremental** vs. **transformational** change.
* "Rewiring" SES includes, amongst other functions, norms, values, beliefs (p. 276).
* "breaking down the resilience of features of the current systems that constrain transformation" (p. 276).
* "Lack of certainty also remains on how to collectively make decisions about new directions whent here is so much uncertainty, surprise, and turbulence" (p. 276).
