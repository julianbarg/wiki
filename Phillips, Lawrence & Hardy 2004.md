## Propositions

> 1. Actions that require organizational sensemaking are more likely to result in the production of texts that are widely disseminated and consumed than actions that do not.
2. Actions that affect perceptions of the organization's legitimacy are more likely to result in the production of texts that are widely disseminated and consumed than actions that do not.
3. Texts that are produced by actors who are understood to have a legitimate right to speak, who have resource power or formal authority, or who are centrally located in a field are more likely to become embedded in discourse than texts that are not.
4. Texts that take the form of genres, which are recognizable, interpretable, and usable in other organizations, are more likely to become embedded in discourse than texts that do not.
5. Texts that draw on other texts within the discourse and on other well-established discourses are more likely to become embedded in discourse than texts that do not.
6. Discourses that are more coherent and structured are more likely to produce institutions than those that are not.
    
* _Comment_: Not true for conspiracy theories

> 7. Discourses that are supported by broader discourses and are not highly contested by competing discourses are more likely to produce institutions than discourses that are not.

## One-paragraph summary

Sets up the idea that a stable discourse constitutes an institution [cf. @Steinberg1999]. Unfortunately, the article also carries a taint of rational discourse--akin to @Habermas1984--see for instance Proposition 6.
