## RBV and [[Dynamic Capabilities]]

Both RBV and [[Dynamic Capabilities]] are independent theories. To make an explicit connection between them is still important: Dynamic Capabilities set out to solve a problem that RBV first explored, and as a result developed some overlapping, and some distinct assumptions and perspectives.

## One-paragraph summary
The I/O literature had for decades held that to create value, a firm needs to be in the right industry - a profitable one. On the one hand, [[Rumelt 1991]] put that notion into question when when he provided evidence that profits are distributes very unequally within industries. On the other hand, Barney (1991) points out that the mobility of resources, which is assumed to exist in the I/O literature, implies that advantages within industries are always short-lived - an assumption that RBV does not share. Instead, RBV holds that companies can own resources (not products) that allow them to build sustained competitive advantages in industries. In Barney's definition of RBV, resources need to be valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable to constitute a source of a sustained competitive advantage.
