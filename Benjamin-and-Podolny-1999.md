## One-page summary

### Goal of the Paper
* Examines how a producer’s status in the market influences choices about product quality and outcomes that result 
* Clarify mechanism behind the stability of status overtime (Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001): demonstrates how current affiliations affect and constrain returns to subsequent affiliation 
* Looks at how status influences returns to past quality – Matthew Effect (accumulated advantage) 

### The process of status begetting status
1. Producers with high-status are more visible and receive positively biased evaluations 
2. High-status producers gain more incentive for producing high-quality products -> choose to produce high-quality products 
3. On the other hand, low-status producers are less visible and receive negatively biased evaluations 
4. Low-status producers gain little incentive for producing high-quality products (spent a lot to make high-quality products, but evaluation is not good) -> choose to produce low-quality products 
5. High-status producers produce high-quality products, low-quality produce low-quality products, which leads them into a cycle of remaining in high- and low-status, respectively. 

### Findings
Affiliation (indicating status) is positively related to price, is positively moderating past quality (reputation) to present price, and positively related to quality. Also, higher status accrues greater net benefits from subsequent high-status affiliation. 

### Discussions
This paper compares the economic and sociological perspectives of reputation/status. In economic perspective, reputation plays the role of signaling past quality, whereas sociological models of status depends on affiliations. 

This paper shows that reputation and status have an interactive relationship of reinforcing one another, leading to Matthew Effect in status.
