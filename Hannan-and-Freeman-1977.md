## One-paragraph summary
Previous literature mostly discusses firms' abilities to adapt. But firms' abilities to adapt are limited because of structural inertia. When we take this inertia serious, it is more valuable to think about niches that companies occupy, and how changes (or the absence of change) in the environment affects firms' survival. Specialists take a very specific niche, and owing to their excellent fit, they can derive many resources from that niche. Generalists on the other hand can feast from many different niches. When the environment is stable, specialists are at advantage. But when the environment shifts, generalists can offset losses in one niche by relying on other, new or old, niches. Therefore, Hannan and Freeman 1977 predict that we can find specialists in stable environment, and generalists in unstable environments.

## One-page summary
“Why are there so many different kinds of organizations?” Previously most research attempted to answer this question through an adaptation perspective, which posits that subunits of the organization scan the relevant environment for opportunities and threats by agents (managers or dominant coalitions), formulate strategies and adjust organizational structure accordingly. Hannan and Freeman (1977) argue that this theoretical angel has two issues: 1) by limiting the unit of analysis on organizations, the literature incurs a survival bias, 2) the internal and external inertia imposed on organizations made it unlikely for organizations to adjust. 

Instead, they propose to look for the source of organizations' heterogeneity from a selection perspective, thereby moving the unit of analysis to the population of organizations. These populations consist of all the organizations within a particular system that share a common form. The form indicates a blueprint which contains the rules for transforming inputs into outputs. Systems are characterized by geography, political boundaries, market or product considerations. Hannan and Freeman (1977) argue that at the population level, organizations have similar means of adapting to environmental situations: all members share to some extent the the consequences of organizational success or failure. 

Their analysis departs from Hawley’s (1968) classical model of human ecology, which suggested that the diversity of organizational forms are isomorphic to the diversity of environments. In each distinctive environmental configuration, assuming an equilibrium has been achieved, there will be an optimal form of organization contingency on the environment. Hannan and Freeman (1977) extended Hawley’s mode in two aspects: 1) articulating the selection process by including a  theory which considers the finite and fixed nature of resources available in an environment. 2) Explainign the dynamic considerations through niche-width. Niche, defined as “that area in constraint space in which the population outcompetes all other local populations”, consists of all those combinations of resources levels at which the population can survive and reproduce itself. They distinguishe two strategies for survival: the generalists who possess the excess capacity necessary to thrive and reproduce in diverse, changing and uncertain environments, and the specialists who exhibit a limited range of tolerance to environmental variations but has very good access to resources in its nieche. They suggested that environmental niches vary along two dimensions: 1) they are fine-grained when “a typical element (organization) encounters many units or replications" (Hannan and Freeman 1977: 951) or when typical durations in states are short relative to the lifetime of organizations, or otherwise 2) coarse grained (less frequent and prolonged). Specialists, which tend to be smaller and leaner, are more likely to be successful in fine-grained environments while generalist are better able to cope with coarse-grained, uncertain environments with the excess capacity to be resilient during environmental fluctuations. During the selection process by competition only large and small organizations on the two ends will finally survive, medium-sized organizations will be eliminated in stable environments, as they neither enjoy access to the riches that exists across different niches (as the generalists do), nor access to the riches that exist (deep within) in niches as the specialists do.

In terms of theory, Hannan and Freeman extend the selection perspective by offering an alternative explanation to the adaptation perspective in explaining “why there are many kinds of organizations.” Methodologically, they pointed out the importance of studying small organizations rather than just focusing on the surviving big players.
