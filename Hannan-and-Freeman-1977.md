## One-page summary
“Why are there so many different kinds of organizations?” Previously most research attempted to answer this question through an adaptation perspective, which posited that subunits of the organization scan the relevant environment for opportunities and threats by agents (managers or dominant coalitions), formulate strategies and adjust organizational structure accordingly. Although partially explained the question, Hannan and Freeman (1977) argued that such theoretical angel had two issues: 1) by limiting the unit of analysis on organizations, they tended to have a survival bias, 2) the internal and external inertia posed on organizations made it less likely for organizations to adjust. 

Instead, they proposed to analyze this question through a selection perspective and moving the unit of analysis to organization population, which consists of all the organizations within a particular boundary that have a common form exists or is realized within a specified system. The form indicates a blueprint which contains the rules for transforming inputs into outputs. Systems are characterized by geography, political boundaries, market or product considerations. The reason to conduct the research on population level is to analyze similar organizations aggregated in a higher level, which has collective means of adapting to environmental situations: all members share to some extent in the consequence of organizational success or failure. 

Their analysis departed from Hawley’s (1968) classical model of human ecology, which suggested that the diversity of organizational forms are isomorphic to the diversity of environments. In each distinctive equilibrium environmental configuration, there will be an optimal form of organization contingent to the environment. Hannan and Freeman (1977) extended Hawley’s mode in two aspects: 1) articulating the selection process by adding a competition theory, which considers the finite and fixed nature of resources available in an environment, and competition. (During the selection process by competition only large and small organizations on the two ends will finally survive, medium-sized organizations will be eliminated in stable environment.) 2) introducing the dynamic considerations through niche-width. Niche, defined as “that area in constraint space in which the population outcompetes all other local populations”, consists of all those combinations of resources levels at which the population can survive and reproduce itself. They distinguished two strategies for survival: the generalists who hold the excess capacity to thrive and reproduce in diverse, changing and uncertain environments, and the specialists who exhibit a limited range of tolerance to environmental variations. They suggested that environmental niches vary along two dimensions: 1) fine-grained when “a typical element (organization) encounters many units or replications or when typical durations in states are short relative to the lifetime of organizations, or otherwise 2) coarse grained (less frequent and prolonged). Specialists, which tend to be smaller and leaner, are more likely to be successful in fine-grained enlivenments while generalist are better able to cope with coarse-grained, uncertain environments with the excess capacity to be resilient during environmental fluctuations. 

Theoretically, they extended the selection perspective to offer an alternative explanation to the adaptation perspective in explaining “why there are many kinds of organizations.” Methodologically, they pointed out the importance of studying small organizations rather than just focusing on the surviving big players.
