## Summary

## Significance

Maybe around this time we see the rise of leak detection software. Interestingly, the leak detection software throws an alarm, but the controller seems to ignore it, and starts another pump. Maybe the software still needs to gain legitimacy/authority? Maybe controllers aren't very cautious, or have seen too many false positives/are conditioned to ignore the alarm? Even more interesting is that the pump is later stopped only after another employee smells gasoline odors - a truly unusual occurance [@NTSB p. 7]?

## My reactions
* Another incident that the PHMSA did not update on in its database. I can see why the [[commentator|Houston '94##regarding-phmsa-research-and-action]] on [[Houston '94]] as well as the NTSB in general got fed up with the DOT. Assumin that the PHMSA researchers rely on the PHMSA database, it would be fair  assume that they would have a bias toward drawing on data of spills where the cause of the incident is immediately clear and reported in the PHMSA incident report. Fortunately, PHMSA changed their policy starting in 2002 and began to update the database later.
* We continue to see a response that is more focused on discussing the response. Is the message: despite the spill, the deaths should have been avoidable? So is the blame for the injuries put on the rescue personnel instead of the operator? Should rescue personnel be obliged to respon perfectly to an incidents? Is that part of our social contract?

*A story as old as time:

> The system administrator said he noticed that the records now contained a typographical error that he said was not there when he created them. [@NTSB2002 p. 7]

## Data

### PHMSA narrative

> "Mainline 16\" pipline rupture.  Cause is being investigated by the ntsb and dot office of pipeline safety.  Initial examination of the pipe revealed a 28\" longintudinal spill and gouges and dents adjacent to the rupture area.  Details to be provided following the ntsb investigation.  Supplemental info:  mainline 16\" pipeline ruptured.  Initial examination of the failed pipe revealed at 28\" longitudinal split with gouges and dents adjacent to the rupture area.  The impact of this damage on the pipes failure, as well as all other potential causes including the functioning of surge relief equipment, is under current investigation by the ntsb and the dot office of pipeline safety."

### Quantitative data

According to the PHMSA dataset, the line had been tested for a pressure of 1,620 psig.

## Notes
* Is it that because the computers for the SCADA system were down, the controller did not notice the drop in pressure?
* The leak detection software detects a leak, but the controller started another pump. The pump is eventually stopped after an employee reports gasoline odors [@NTSB2002 p. 7].
* The spill most likely began at 3:28 PM [@NTSB2002 p. 5]. At 4:11PM some operations were resumed [@NTSB2002 p. 7]. At about 4:30PM an emergency response began [@NTSB2002 p. 9].
