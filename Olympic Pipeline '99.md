## My reactions
* Another incident that the PHMSA did not update on in its database. I can see why the [[commentator|Houston '94##regarding-phmsa-research-and-action]] on [[Houston '94]] as well as the NTSB in general got fed up with the DOT. Assumin that the PHMSA researchers rely on the PHMSA database, it would be fair to assume that they would have a bias toward drawing on data of spills where the cause of the incident is immediately clear and reported in the PHMSA incident report. Fortunately, PHMSA changed their policy starting in 2002 and began to update the database later.

## Various

*A story as old as time:

> The system administrator said he noticed that the records now contained a typographical error that he said was not there when he created them.

Initial examination of the pipe revealed a 28\" longintudinal spill and gouges and dents adjacent to the rupture area.  Details to be provided following the ntsb investigation.  Supplemental info:  mainline 16\" pipeline ruptured.  Initial examination of the failed pipe revealed at 28\" longitudinal split with gouges and dents adjacent to the rupture area.  The impact of this damage on the pipes failure, as well as all other potential causes including the functioning of surge relief equipment, is under current investigation by the ntsb and the dot office of pipeline safety."

### Quantitative data

According to the PHMSA dataset, the line had been tested for a pressure of 1,620 psig.
