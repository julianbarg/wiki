# @Catton1978

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

* First defines the _New Ecological Paradigm_

## One-sentence summary

@Catton1978 first challenge the _Human Exceptionalism Paradigm_ and propose the _New Environmental Paradigm_. Rather than being based on a goal, the NEP is based on a justification--that is, the authors introduce why there is no alternative to adopting it over the long run.

## Definitions

* _New Environmental Paradigm_
    
>   1. Human beings are but one species among the many that are interdependently involved in the biotic communities that shape our social life.
>   2. Intricate linkages of cause and effect and feedback in the web of nature produce many unintended consequences from purposive human action.
>   3. The world is finite, so there are potent physical and biological limits constraining economic growth, social progress, and other societal phenomena.
