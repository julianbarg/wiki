## One-paragraph summary
Companies plan for their decisions. Therefore, the precedents of a decision cannot be dismissed. Shaver (1998) builds two different models to demonstrate the importance of taking decision making into consideration. In the first, regular probit model, acquisition entry (into another country) is shown to decrease chances of survival. The second model includes the likelihood for a firm to choose acquisition entry over greenfield investment (Heckman Selection Model). In this second model, acquisition entry is not significant anymore, the effect has been moderated by the correction for self-selection. The implication of this paper is that companies might be right in choosing the path that, on aggregate, yields lower survival chances. For their specific case, it might be the right decision. This might be where there is potential for models that alleviate problems with endogeneity to inform research on capabilities. Capabilities can inform our research, but only if endogenous factors, like strategical decisions, are accounted for.

## One-page summary
The article highlights, and in a way challenges the method of evaluating performance, which has been historically adopted by many scholars. The core argument is that the strategic choices the firms make are endogenous, and self-selected, and the empirical models that do not account for this selection issue are potentially misspecified. The article spotlights the inherent contradiction in the approach in strategy research, where on the one hand the performance is estimated as if the firms choose strategies randomly, and on the other hand a specific strategy is claimed to be outcome of effective decision making by the firms. The author shows this in context of internationalization strategy of firms linking entry mode strategy with performance.  

The article then explains the rationale and econometrics of self-selection in strategic decisions. The fundamental rationale is the argument that firms don‚Äôt make decisions randomly, and they are likely to chose the option that will result in a better performance. Hence, the firms choosing one strategy over the other are likely to be different from the other firms in their idiosyncratic characteristics, as well as the market characteristics. Because of this, what a researcher observes in a cross-section or panel data, are two set of firms, which are not true counterfactuals of each other. The author explains this logic with the example of internationalization strategy of firms in selecting the mode of entry into a foreign market, either through acquisition, or through greenfield entry.

The first equation estimates the strategic decision of entry mode which largely depends on the firm‚Äôs competitive advantage with respect to given market, while the second equation estimates the performance after choosing a particular entry mode. The vector X<sub>i</sub> may include some of the factors of vector W<sub>i</sub>, and the error terms, u<sub>i</sub> and –Ñ<sub>i</sub> are likely to be correlated because of the unobserved variables that influence the entry mode strategy, as well as performance. Because of this correlation the expected value of performance is conditional on the choice of entry, and hence the coefficient of interest ùõø is likely to be biased in the direction of correlation between error terms.  

The article then empirically shows how this bias can be corrected for by employing Hackman‚Äôs (1979) two stage model, where an estimate of inverse mills ratio, Œª, is obtained for each observation by running a probit model on equation 1, and that ratio is utilized as an independent variable in equation 2 to account for self-selection bias. The author shows that when self-selection is accounted for, the significance of the entry mode variable disappears.  

Finally, I wanted to raise some questions to clarify my understanding of the method. First, the underlying argument of inverse mills ratio is based on the correlated errors in two equations, which relies on the assumption that the unobservables for the two equations are same. What if some of the unobservables are same, while some are different, can we still apply this method? Second, can this method be used in conjunction with other methods like matching? As I see both methods trying to deal with the issue of endogeneity, albeit in different ways.
