1. Research should be concerned with the actual environment (not with "the" general environment). This gives non-insiders a way in.
2. Research should illustrate, vividly, the impact on the (usually local) environment that the author talks about:
    a. One pathway toward illustrating the impact is to describe exemplary incidents.
    b. Another pathway is to describe hypothetical scenarios that may occur if no action is taken.
3. If the research is not concerned with the actual environment, two other approaches are permissible:
    a. Research that allows "insiders" to refocus their work for it to become more relevant.
    b. Research that shows non-insiders where their work touches on sustainability concerns--and hence gives them a way in.
