# KXL data & theory

[[_TOC_]]

[[Back to KXL|Keystone XL]]

## Goals

* Show purposive actions _and_ reactions
* Show interaction & unintended consequences
* Show how actors learng the rules of the game, and _game_ the rules
    * _Go meta_
* Differentiate parties by values, not by tactics/rhetorics
    * There might be different, culturally determined preferences, but I am not getting into that 
* Take a step back and show what this means for the _overall_ process
    * Potentially in something like a conclusion
    * Keyword: Garbage can model
