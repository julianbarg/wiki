Part of: [[Organizational Theory]]

## One-paragraph summary
Economic theory assumes that firms maximize profits, but the reality is that firms do not freely choose their strategy and implement changes. There is significant path dependence. Nelson and Winter were the first to formalize this view. They hold that routines are sustained, and there are metaroutines that allow for limited adjustment of routines.
