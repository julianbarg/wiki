# Reaction to [[Madsen and Desai 2010]]

I might be able to compare time as a learning factor versus failure as a learning factor (plus technology). How does learning on number of pipeline failures look versus learning on the time passed/volumn of oil transported?

If I were to build on Madsen and Desai, the story would probably of how incidents are "digested" in such fashion that learning does not take place.

A strong observation: safety is mostly a choice, with diverging preferences on cost and safety. The view of states or safety regimes fits within this view. When the current states is found from feedback not to be suitable, sweeping change is implemented. Then, there exist a "paradox"/dichotomy of safety. The organization could at any time opt for thicker pipes/better material and coating/more inspections, but at the same time the organization "could not", because it cannot "imagine" the alternative state (because the cost is perceived as prohibitive/it is considered an over-the-top/underoptimized approach, etc.).
