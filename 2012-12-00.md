## Reaction to [[Madsen and Desai 2010]]

* I might be able to compare time as a learning factor versus failure as a learning factor (plus technology). How does learning on number of pipeline failures look versus learning on the time passed/volumn of oil transported?

* If I were to build on Madsen and Desai, the story would probably of how incidents are "digested" in such fashion that learning does not take place.

* A strong observation: safety is mostly a choice, with diverging preferences on cost and safety. The view of states or safety regimes fits within this view. When the current states is found from feedback not to be suitable, sweeping change is implemented. Then, there exist a "paradox"/dichotomy of safety. The organization could at any time opt for thicker pipes/better material and coating/more inspections, but at the same time the organization "could not", because it cannot "imagine" the alternative state (because the cost is perceived as prohibitive/it is considered an over-the-top/underoptimized approach, etc.).

* How do organizations define their peer group?

* Did pipelines become thicker over time?

* There is a reference group for pipeline safety, and there is an individual intercept of what level of safety is acceptable. A certain level of performance, relative to the peer group is found acceptable. Regulatory regimes play a role, but the actual level of performance may seem "random" (actually, it is the outcome of the individual company's history). Could we prove this by showing that there is a significant intercept for every "industry" (e.g., pipeline operator, utility, extraction)?

## Reaction point

The learning, and related literatures offer an extensive, and fairly tangible understanding of what knowledge is, how it is created and preserved, and how it serves the goals of an organization. This literature, however, has a focus on knowledge that is "useful" or "desirable". Missing is a sense of knowledge whose utility is not clear, the "slack" of knowledge so to say. For instance, an organization at any point carries out many activities, but only some activities contribute to the organization's revenues. Other activities may be necessary, but their utility is more opaque - these activities are commonly known as cost centers. Banks for instance make money from financial transactions, and the value of knowledge on customer acquisition is immediately obvious. The value of a well-run IT department however may be less obvious (although at times the lack thereof can become painfully obvious).
