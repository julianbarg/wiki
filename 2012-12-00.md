# Reaction to [[Madsen and Desai 2010]]

I might be able to compare time as a learning factor versus failure as a learning factor (plus technology). How does learning on number of pipeline failures look versus learning on the time passed/volumn of oil transported?

If I were to build on Madsen and Desai, the story would probably of how incidents are "digested" in such fashion that learning does not take place.
