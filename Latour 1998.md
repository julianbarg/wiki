# @Latour1998

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

* French philosopher

## One-sentence summary

Latour rants about the political branch of ecology. A valid complaint is that the political branch of ecology concerns itself little with valid understanding of our world and much with power politics, or, more precisely, a reversal of the existing regime.
