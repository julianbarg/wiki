## Notes

### Temporality
Why not distribute a case that uses NPV and provides different discount rates in different cases, and then let students discuss it, and discover their discount rates are different. One could probably also run an experiment based on this idea: can we nudge students toward choosing a certain discount rate? Could we determine the attitude of students toward a project, and subsequently observe how they adjust the discount rate?

### Teaching
In first session, for mini case, assign roles of pro, con and agitator, to make students aware of implications of debate culture. Let each group be aware of group members, but not members of other groups. Repeat without/with only agitators.
