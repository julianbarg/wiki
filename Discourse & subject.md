@Maguire2009 draw on Foucault when discussing the nature of discourse. Central to their argument are the power/knowledge relations that make their imprint on the discourse on DDT. The subject of this discourse is DDT, and its impact on the environment. The _subject_ and its creation through discourse take a central role in Foucault's paramount works. _Madness and Civilization_ is concerned with the treatment--not always in a medical sense--of the mentally ill beginning in the Renaissance. _Discipline and Punish_ with punishment--not only of crime--through the ages. The attentive reader can probably guess what _The History of Sexuality_ is about.

As one can probably guess from the fact Foucault has published a book called _Power/Knowledge_, the relationship between power and knowledge takes a prominent position in his work on discourses. In his books, Foucault shows us how the discourse on a subject changes over time, and how power is steadily excerted over the subject. For instance, _Madness and Civilization_ describes how one treatment regime is replaced by another. 

* power over subject
* creation of subject
* limited influence of subject (e.g., in _Discipline and Punish_ economic consequences from use of prison labor)
* going frome one state to another
    * strength is in describing the states from the authors perspective
    * also describing how the previous state constitutes the current one, despite the new one often being in response to the flaws that were seen in the previous one
    * but transition is not the emphasis of the analysis
    * the transition is a state, and that state is described, but rarely the conflicts
        * only in the sense "x disagreed with y and replaced y"
* Power is exerted over subject, few power conflicts over meaning

does not demonstrate how power is exercised
