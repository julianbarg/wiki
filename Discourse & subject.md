@Maguire2009 draw on Foucault when theorizing discourse. Central to their argument are the power/knowledge relations that shape the discourse on DDT. The subject of this discourse is DDT, and its impact on the environment. The _subject_ and its creation through discourse take a central role in Foucault's paramount works. _Madness and Civilization_ is concerned with the treatment--not always in a medical sense--of the mentally ill beginning in the Renaissance. _Discipline and Punish_ with punishment--not only of crime--through the ages. The attentive reader can probably guess what _The History of Sexuality_ is about.

As one can probably guess from the fact Foucault has published a book called _Power/Knowledge_, the relationship between power and knowledge takes a prominent position in his work on discourses. In his books, Foucault shows us how the discourse on a subject changes over time, and how power is steadily exerted over the subject. For instance, _Madness and Civilization_ describes how one treatment regime is replaced by another. Bethlem Royal Hospital in London is rebuild after the _Report on the Care of the Insane_ reveals the inhumane treatment of the _insane_ around the late eighteenth century. The rebuild, and the new language in the report signify a transition to a new discourse, and with it a transition to a more humane treatment regime. What both the old and the new discourse have in common that they _create_ their subject--on a population, they impose a label, raise a model of insanity and the insane, and prescribe a treatment. Each discourse may identify a slightly different population as relevant, but there is a continuity for instance in the power being exerted over the group, even though how power is exerted has changed. Each discourse includes an implicit definition of what the subject _is_--e.g., animalistic vs. abused and dehumanized--and how it is ought to be treated [@Foucault1965]. 

The primary focus of Foucaults work is the transition from one discourse to another. Discourses leave imprints, without the process being deterministic. As Foucualt's focus evolved, he included some dyatic elements into his work--where they appear in the discourse. For instance, _Discipline and Punish_ describes the consequences that prison labor had on the external workforce. Free or cheap labor in the prison would compete with regular workshops in the economy. Free--primarily--women lost their work, were at risk of being driven into prostitution, and ending up at the prison themselves. But these dyatic relationships are rare in the books. More frequently, relationships are expressed in terms of the progression from one discourse to the _contending_ next discourse.

The strength of Foucault's work is the attention to each discourse, as opposed to processes of transition processes (unless one considers each discourse to be transitional). Foucault describes in its own right each discourse, each ranging a few decades. He takes the utmost care to use primary material and describe the discourse from the perspective of the authors. The reader can witness for herself the perspective taken in each discourse. Typically, a chapter comprises a discourse, with some space given the opening on how the discourse differs from the preceding one, and what elements of the preceding discourse the new discourse responds to. The new discourse disagrees with and displaces the existing one, before coming to exert power over the subject.

While it would be false to say that Foucault is irrelevant to contemporary analysis, it is important to note what he does, and what he _does not do_ in his analysis. Foucault remains faithful to the authors when describing discourse. He describes complex developments over extended periods of time. And his attention goes specifically to processes of power being exerted over marginalized communities over extended periods of time. Using this mode of analysis one could e.g., contrasts modern industrialism, business sustainability, and deep ecology, and analyze how power over the environment and man is exerted in each of them. Admittedly, the mode of analysis is less suitable for analysis of e.g., the conflict over the fossil fuel industry in the US. The conflict over fossil fuels is characterized by the coexistence of diverging discourses. However, at this time largely only one discourse--the orthodox industrial, often capitalist view--exerts power over the natural environment. Conflicts between the participants, which often fall outside the realm of textual discourse, are not the focus of Foucauldian discourse analysis. A "compromise" could be found in an analysis of business culture before and after environmental activists challenge common business practices. We would expect to find that both before and after the rise of environmental activism, industries exert power over the environment, but that the way how power is exerted has changed. For instance, we commonly now see business practices that have responses to environmentalism built-in-- power is exerted not only over nature, but over environmental groups also.

<!--* limited influence of subject (e.g., in _Discipline and Punish_ economic consequences from use of prison labor)
* going frome one state to another
    * strength is in describing the states from the authors perspective
    * also describing how the previous state constitutes the current one, despite the new one often being in response to the flaws that were seen in the previous one
    * but transition is not the emphasis of the analysis
    * the transition is a state, and that state is described, but rarely the conflicts
        * only in the sense "x disagreed with y and replaced y"
* Power is exerted over subject, few power conflicts over meaning

does not demonstrate how power is exercised
