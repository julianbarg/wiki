@Maguire2009 draw on Foucault when theorizing about discourse. Central to their argument are the power/knowledge relations that make shape the discourse on DDT. The subject of this discourse is DDT, and its impact on the environment. The _subject_ and its creation through discourse take a central role in Foucault's paramount works. _Madness and Civilization_ is concerned with the treatment--not always in a medical sense--of the mentally ill beginning in the Renaissance. _Discipline and Punish_ with punishment--not only of crime--through the ages. The attentive reader can probably guess what _The History of Sexuality_ is about.

As one can probably guess from the fact Foucault has published a book called _Power/Knowledge_, the relationship between power and knowledge takes a prominent position in his work on discourses. In his books, Foucault shows us how the discourse on a subject changes over time, and how power is steadily excerted over the subject. For instance, _Madness and Civilization_ describes how one treatment regime is replaced by another. After the _Report on the Care of the Insane_ reveals the inhumane treatment of the _insane_ around the late eighteenth century, Bethlem Royal Hospital in London is rebuild. The rebuild, and the new language in the report signify a transition to a new discourse, and with it a transition to a more humane treatment regime. What both the old and the new discourse have in common that they _create_ their subject--on a population, they impose a label and prescribe a treatment. Each discourse identifies a different population as relevant, but there is a continuity for instance in the power being excerted over the group, even though how power is excerted has changed. The discourse includes an implicit definition of what the subject _is_--e.g., animalistic vs. abused and dehumanized--and how it is ought to be treated [@Foucault1965]. 

The primary focus of Foucaults work is the transition from one discourse to another, and how the preceding discourse 

As Foucualt's focus evolved, he included some dyatic elements into his work--where they appear in the discourse. For instance, _Discipline and Punish_ describes the consequences that prison labor had on the external workforce. Free or cheap labor in the prison would compete with regular workshops in the economy. Free--primarily--women lost their work, were at risk of being driven into prostitution, and ending up at the prison themselves.

But these dyatic relationships are rare, and more commonly 

* limited influence of subject (e.g., in _Discipline and Punish_ economic consequences from use of prison labor)
* going frome one state to another
    * strength is in describing the states from the authors perspective
    * also describing how the previous state constitutes the current one, despite the new one often being in response to the flaws that were seen in the previous one
    * but transition is not the emphasis of the analysis
    * the transition is a state, and that state is described, but rarely the conflicts
        * only in the sense "x disagreed with y and replaced y"
* Power is exerted over subject, few power conflicts over meaning

does not demonstrate how power is exercised
