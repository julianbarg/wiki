@Maguire2009 draw on Foucault when discussing the nature of discourse. Central to their argument are the power/knowledge relations that make their imprint on the discourse on DDT. The subject of this discourse is DDT, and its impact on the environment.

The attentive reader can probably guess what _The History of Sexuality_ is about.
