## One-paragraph summary

A comprehensive review of ecological thinking, including its counterpart--anthropocentrism. The authors describe the roots of anthroprocentrism in ideas of Enlightment, including the _linear perspective_, the _Camera Theory of Knowledge_--the belief that a scene captured by an onlooker constitutes objective knowledge, and a sense of _Human-Nature Dualism_. These manifest in organization science in an overtly technological epistemology ("_technological knowledge_")--the reductionist belief that one can objectively describe the world from an individual perspective and resolve all problems by applying technology ("'you can't stand in the way of progress'", p. 1060). Further, organizations display an _Egocentric Orientation_. This _Egocentric Orientation_ is fostered not only by the _ethical egoism_ of Ayn Rand (and probably the Friedman doctrine), but also by organizational theories that promote a view of a "_task_" environment as exclusively in service of the focal firm's growth such as the resource-dependence model or population ecology.

Within ecological thinking, the authors identify two competing strands--the _Environmental Management Paradigm_ and _Ecocentrism_. They claim that the _Environmental Management Paradigm_ is not a promising approach to resolving environmental problems, as it does not fundamentally alter the relationship between organizations and the environment. Only a paradigm that takes serious the integrity of an ecosystem as a legitimate goal to pursue, independent of its usefulness for humanity, could accomplish such goal. The authors' description of the status quo and potential future scenarios here seems quite accurate. They then introduce several strands of ecological thinking in a useful literature review, especially the discourse on _ecosystem health_ and _ecocentric environmental ethics_ (e.g., Aldo Leopold). The authors conclude with a laundry list of items that they hope be implemented for the benefit of nature and future generations, such as _ecological choice_ and _ecological democracy_, in an enviable display of naivity.
