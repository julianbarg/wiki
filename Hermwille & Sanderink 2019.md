* Fossil fuel industry: 3 trade associations and 2 major companies

## One-sentence summary

The oil industry is consistent with its messaging across time--they state that they are up to the task of "emission reduction" by employing natural gas and employing technology--even after Trump pulls out of the Paris Agreement. The coal industry associations on the other hand signal that there is a conspiracy against coal underway, and that coal is vital to America's survival. After Trump pulls out of the climate accord, the industry signals that it is now being unleashed. Even Peabody, the biggest actor in the industry which did not share the "conspiracy" message, sings this tune--despite the company having to file for bankruptcy in 2016.
