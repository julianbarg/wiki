## One-page summary
Maslach et al. (2018) touch on three learning related concepts: (1) learning from failure, (2) vicarous learning, and (3) learning from rare events. They use the MAUDE dataset for their study, which is a dataset of medical device reports (reports of failure of devices, or adverse events that may be related to medical devices).

The paper builds on two theoretical bases. Vicarious learning assumes that firm learn from "similar and more successful [other firms, ... but] only imitate success" (ibid. 225f.). Learning from rare events entails the time-consuming interpretation of individual events.

Maslach et al. (2018) observe that relative to success, failure is an underutilized source of learning ("actors only imitate success"; ibid. 226). (Vicarious) Learning from rare events is a possible remedy to the first problem. But signal extraction from repositories (or other sources for vicarious learning from failure) does not follow the same mechanisms that learning would usually follow. Repositories oversample on failure, thus, organizations need to purposely look for information that may apply to them. Otherwise, there is a risk of reacting to noise.

Maslach et al. (2018) explore these propositions empirically by...

To realize repository-based learning, the qualitative evidence suggest that organizations both analyze failure modes and protocol violations. Learning is accomplished if patterns emerge out of multiple instances of such observations. Relevant "noise" in these observations can be reporting delays, which indicate that reporting organizations were not aware of the protocol observations or other issues at the time.

The article contributes to a literature that challenges an implicit (/unproclaimed) core assumption of the learning literature: learning either should or simply does take place when successful organizations' attributes are reproduced by other organizations. Instead, learning can also originate from failure events. Further, by learning from rare events, or a repository, organizations can enlarge the pool of material that they learn from. Learning from these rare events, and even from what might be considered "noise", is possible. More general, (as already laid out by [[March Sproull and Tamuz 1991]]) learning flows from concrete experiences, rather than the sum of a model's knowledge stock.
