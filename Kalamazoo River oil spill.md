### PHMSA narrative

On july 26, 2010, enbridge confirmed a mainline rupture on line 6b at mp608.2452.  During the investigation it was determined that the rupture occurred simultaneously with a scheduled pipeline shutdown.  As a result of the incident phmsa issued a corrective action order that ordered the pipeline to remain shut down until such time that the activities outlined in the cao were satisfied.  Enbridge satisfied all conditions of the cao and received approval from phmsa to resume operations on september 27, 2010 at which time enbridge successfully restarted the line.      Of further note, while the telephonic report to the nrc is stated as 13:33 on july 26, 2010, enbridge made a call to nrc and was on hold for a period of time.  Enbridge then hung up the call and called again at which time it was on hold for a further period of time.  The stated 13:33 reflects the time that enbridge was able to provide verbal notification of the incident.    The release was initially estimated at 19,500 barrels of which an undetermined amount entered the talmadge creek and ultimately the kalamazoo river.  The amount of estimated product released in or reaching water has not yet been confirmed and is based upon a calculation provided by an external consultant.  The amount of oil that reached water is subject to further investigation.  Enbridge is currently reviewing several methodologies to calculate this volume, and will communicate the methodology and subsequent volume to phmsa upon completion.     The section that failed has been sent to a laboratory for a metallurgical analysis, under the direction of ntsb. Pending the results of metallurgical testing and failure investigations, enbridge is unable to provide complete and final data for this original report submission. Information contained in this report is to be considered estimated until supplemental and final reports are filed. Ntsb, phmsa and enbridge investigations into this accident have commenced. As this investigation is ongoing, the primary and secondary cause(s) have not been finalized.    To date, enbridge has not found any potable water sources (public or private) with drinking water contamination that has been verifiably linked to the enbridge release. The assessment of all drinking water sources in the affected area is ongoing. Enbridge is in the process of sampling drinking water sources and is working directly with state and local public health officials in evaluating drinking water from potable wells to ensure public health.    Enbridge estimated that it will incur aggregate charges between $300 million and $400 million. These charges include emergency response, environmental remediation and cleanup activities associated with the crude oil release, costs to repair the pipeline and related inspection costs, potential claims by third parties, and lost revenue. We continue to work to accurately project the total cost of the leak and its remediation, however we are unable to break it down into the specific detail requested in this form due to the complexity of the efforts.    As further information becomes known, supplemental reports will be filed as required.    See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of december 20, 2010.  See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of february 22, 2011.  See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of march 6, 2012.  See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of june 28, 2013.

## Resources

## Notes
* 81% if the material was spilled when Enbridge attempted to restart the pipeline.
* Multiple alarms within the first five minutes: a severe alarm, two warning alarms, a severe leak alarm, and 7 other alarms (p. 8f).
* If pressure remains below 1 psig for an extended period of time... seems fairly obvious to me. But most of the operators have probably not seen a major spill before. They may have seen many false positives though (p. 12).
