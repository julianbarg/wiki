### Narrative

Enbridge has a history of flawed integrity management--PHMSA claims a lack of knowledge integration (pp. 70f). However, PHMSA also did not do anything about it (p. 85). A crack grew inside a corroded area of the pipe, where the tape coating had disbonded. The reulations regarding these kinds of cracks are unclear (p. 118). Enbridge's integrity management discovered the flaws as early as 2006, but did not act on it (by imposing pressure restrictions) until 2009 (p. 86). Because part of the assessment was faulty, Enbridge did not act on it, rather waiting for another complete assessment without faults to take place. However, part of the assessment was not faulty, and should have been sufficient to impose repairs or pressure restrictions earlier (pp. 86f).

Although a crack and corrosion occured simultaneously, Enbridge's internal procedures for cracks and corrosions were applied separately. The potantiel for more serious damage to occur when cracks and corrosion appear together was not recognized. In addition, PHMSA's regulation regarding cracks, and regarding the combination of cracks and corrossion is severly lacking (p. 85). Enbridge also did not take the tool tolerance into consideration, or previously collected data (p. 89).

The control center staff did not correctly identify the leak, despire having received adequate information from the SCADA system (p. 119). Shutting down and restarting the line cleared the warning messages (p. 123). The line was restarted twice after the ruptue by one crew, and the third crew considered starting it up again (p. 14). The control center relied on residents informing them of the leak occuring. Enbridge did not have experience in responding to spills in fast-flowing water (p. 119). Becuse PHMSA's regulations are not strict enough, too little resources for emergency response were available.


One thing that comes into focus in the NTSB report are the PHMSA's responses and policies for emergence response (pp. 71ff, p. 76). 

### Factors

* Three main factors: tool tolerance, nominal wall thickness, and interaction of corrosion and cracking. If any of these were considered in calculating failure pressure (or the standards for corrosion instead of those for cracking), excavation would have been required because the failure pressure would have been below the hydrostatic test pressure (p. 91). See also [[resources|Kalamazoo River oil spill#ntsb-summary-of-causes]].

* Disbonding of the coating.
* Combination of crack + coating that had not been considered in organizational procedures and regulations (p. 84).
* Corrosion management program (software) obviously flawed (p. 87).
* Tolerance of measurement tool for cracks (+/- 0.02 inch) not taken into consideration (p. 89).
* Historial data used for prediction crack growth--that data was of a different type (nominal fatigue crack) than the corrosion fatigue crack present here (p. 90).
* New rule for including tool tolerance (introduced in 2007) not applied retroactively to 2005 in-line inspection data (pp. 91f).
* Stutdown and subsequent startup of the line cleared errors (p. 123).

### What could have been done

#### To prevent the spill
* Modern pipe coating would have prevented corrossion (p. 82).

#### To reduce the severity of the spill
* Enbridge should not have relied on the public to recognize and report the spill.
* 911 operators should have contacted Enbridge (p. 103).
* Firefighters should have searched along Line 6B (p. 103).
* Spill response at source.
* Build an underflow dam to reduce severity of the spill (p. 108).
* More resources available on site for response (p. 112).

### Faulty parts/flawed procedures
* PHMSA's oversight of Enbridge's integrity mangement (p. 92).
* Spill response 8.9 miles downstream rather than at source (p. 106).

## Aftermath/learning
* (NTSB recommends) harmonize PHMSA response plan requirements with EPA and Coast Guard (p. 110).

### Enbridge
* Minor changes to operator training (pp. 67f).
* Replacement of some of the pipeline with larger diameter pipes, supposedly also making maintenance easier pp. 66f).
* Used of statistics in integrity management, will probably lead to more excavations (p. 67).
* New control center and some new personnel and structure (pp. 67f).
* "Operators and supervisors were prohibited from overriding approved control-room procedures (p. 68).
* New tool for predicting crack growth considers SCC (but still doesn't consider corrosion fatigue; p. 91).

## My reactions
* The first drill where NTSB unambiguously declares just that organizational failures are the cause (as well as criticism of PHMSA as the regulator).
* This is an industry that has not eliminated severe false positives for 3 decades... How mnany more years should we wait, if we know that false positives basically cannot be entirely excluded (p. 13)?  They could not account for a 10s of thousands of gallons and kept operating the pipeline (p. 13).
* False positives are at fault again (p. 13). Do false positives mean that technically "the technology is not at fault"? Related to this, operator states he has "never seen this" (p. 14).
* Operators have more data available, but otherwise workflows seem as simple or primitive as they have been before (p. 14).
* Decades into the future, we might see a lot of instances of leukemia (p. 18).
* How predictable is crack development? Should we expect extreme outliers?
* How can a spill response in 8 minutes be achieved if there is a 10-minute restriction in place (p. 52).
* The amount of emergency response material available--isn't it better than before? But still not sufficient though (p. 60)?
* Report suggests insufficient oversight by PHMSA--in the original theory, that should not matter for learning curves, but for more behavioral models, the missing feedback matters. Or maybe I should rather say--experience-based models do not discuss the role of the government and other stakeholders in making sure that organizations gather experience. There also is a connection here to March, Sproull & Tamuz (1991).
* One problem seems to be tasks that are infrequently carried out--such as constructing an underflow dam--personnel was aware of the technique, but has not done it before--maybe carried out only 2-3 times even during a full caree (p. 76, p. 79)?
* That "remediation" controversy. Successful lobbying or sensible choice of language? Clearly, it allows operators to hold off repairs. 80% threshold seems ridiculous (p. 84).
* With the high number of defects detected, it is very much possible that the number of cracks & corrosion defects flagged for excavation is a function of Enbridge's capacity for excavation rather than actual need for excavation. If Enbridge did not believe it would be able to excavate a sufficient number of cracks, maybe that is because it would not be profitiable to do so? On the other hand, Enbridge later did replace the pipeline with a new one, and it did also spend much more on clean-up and remediation than it would have in maintenance cost.
* Enbridges prediction of crack growth is based on historical data (p.  90). Hence why the this corrosion fatigue crack was not accurately modeled--the data available is from nominal fatigue cracks.
* All of the issues seem like things that could be cleared up with more experience--but don't they always do?
* At least one of the authors seems not to be an engineer--critique of management practice.
* Are these incidents just bound to occur periodically? When staff grows to careless because an incident has not occured in a while?

### PHMSA narrative

On july 26, 2010, enbridge confirmed a mainline rupture on line 6b at mp608.2452.  During the investigation it was determined that the rupture occurred simultaneously with a scheduled pipeline shutdown.  As a result of the incident phmsa issued a corrective action order that ordered the pipeline to remain shut down until such time that the activities outlined in the cao were satisfied.  Enbridge satisfied all conditions of the cao and received approval from phmsa to resume operations on september 27, 2010 at which time enbridge successfully restarted the line.      Of further note, while the telephonic report to the nrc is stated as 13:33 on july 26, 2010, enbridge made a call to nrc and was on hold for a period of time.  Enbridge then hung up the call and called again at which time it was on hold for a further period of time.  The stated 13:33 reflects the time that enbridge was able to provide verbal notification of the incident.    The release was initially estimated at 19,500 barrels of which an undetermined amount entered the talmadge creek and ultimately the kalamazoo river.  The amount of estimated product released in or reaching water has not yet been confirmed and is based upon a calculation provided by an external consultant.  The amount of oil that reached water is subject to further investigation.  Enbridge is currently reviewing several methodologies to calculate this volume, and will communicate the methodology and subsequent volume to phmsa upon completion.     The section that failed has been sent to a laboratory for a metallurgical analysis, under the direction of ntsb. Pending the results of metallurgical testing and failure investigations, enbridge is unable to provide complete and final data for this original report submission. Information contained in this report is to be considered estimated until supplemental and final reports are filed. Ntsb, phmsa and enbridge investigations into this accident have commenced. As this investigation is ongoing, the primary and secondary cause(s) have not been finalized.    To date, enbridge has not found any potable water sources (public or private) with drinking water contamination that has been verifiably linked to the enbridge release. The assessment of all drinking water sources in the affected area is ongoing. Enbridge is in the process of sampling drinking water sources and is working directly with state and local public health officials in evaluating drinking water from potable wells to ensure public health.    Enbridge estimated that it will incur aggregate charges between $300 million and $400 million. These charges include emergency response, environmental remediation and cleanup activities associated with the crude oil release, costs to repair the pipeline and related inspection costs, potential claims by third parties, and lost revenue. We continue to work to accurately project the total cost of the leak and its remediation, however we are unable to break it down into the specific detail requested in this form due to the complexity of the efforts.    As further information becomes known, supplemental reports will be filed as required.    See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of december 20, 2010.  See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of february 22, 2011.  See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of march 6, 2012.  See attached uploaded file for supplemental narrative as of june 28, 2013.

### NTSB summary of causes

"Therefore, the NTSB concludes that Enbridge’s integrity management program was inadequate because it did not consider the following: a sufficient margin of safety, appropriate wall thickness, tool tolerances, use of a continuous reassessment approach to incorporate lessons learned, the effects of corrosion on crack depth sizing, and accelerated crack growth rates due to corrosion fatigue on corroded pipe with a failed coating" (p.92).

## Notes
* 81% if the material was spilled when Enbridge attempted to restart the pipeline.
* Multiple alarms within the first five minutes: a severe alarm, two warning alarms, a severe leak alarm, and 7 other alarms (p. 8f).
* If pressure remains below 1 psig for an extended period of time... seems fairly obvious to me. But most of the operators have probably not seen a major spill before. They may have seen many false positives though (p. 12).
* Considered leakage as early as 5AM.
* Significant difference in emergency response training vs reality.
* PHMSA form lists zero injuries, but Michigan Department of Community Health identified 331 affected people.
* Embridge has a history of problems with pipeline inspection (pp. 21f).
* Prediction of crack growth rates is very sensitive to data input, e.g., exact size of the original crack.
* Changes of law to require integrity management for HCAs (p. 29).
* Metal loss below 80% does not require immediate repair (p. 31), 50% is theshold of Embridge for repair (p. 32). How fast can you go from 50% to 80% though?
* Limitation of in-line testing (p. 35). Is hydrostatic testing unpopular because the line has to be shut down for a longer time.
* Failure to account for measurement tolerance (p. 35).
* User error for USCD tool? Or faulty user manual? Crack depth and corrosion have to be added. In any case, there is an interaction between cracks and corrosion. Embridge only considered crack depth, but not wall loss from corrosion.
* Crazy amount of corrosion features: 50,270 overall, 1,037 critical ones. However, the ones detected around the rupture did not meet the criteria for excavation. The ones deteced by the fracture were estimated at between 12.5-25% wall thickness.
* Public Awareness Programs effectivenss: why was the caller and the fire department not contacting Enbridge. THey should have the number from this material (p. 42). 
* Why are shift leaders "people persons", instead of engineers (p. 44). Reason is supposedly growth (p. 45)? Most of the staff involved had plenty of experience (p. 46)--is that a good or a bad thing?
* Job training--individual on-the-job training with some online material and testing. Staff is either graduates from technical schools or with relevant experience as operators (pp. 47f). Some not familiar with MBS software (p. 50).
* Column separation is a "known limitation". For MBS analyst, column separation accounts for "three of five" calls per shift. There were also weird shenanigans going on with the software before the shift (p. 51).
* The 10-minute restriction is a cool example of a failure to learn. Is this rule just being knowlingly ignored? Personnel seems to have thought filling in the pipeline would just take longer than 10 minutes (pp. 51f).
* Confusing workflow, unclear responsibilities.
* Up to 2,011 personnel working at the same time.
* Actual incident worse than worst case (p. 59).
* 200 acres of river bottom exhibited moderate-to-heavy contamination. 3,650 reptiles and 196 birds directly affected (p. 63).
* Regarding a prvious spill: "Execution of the PG&E emergency plan resulted in delays that could have been avoided by better utilizing the SCADA center's capability" (p. 64).
* "Discover of condition" was past due date (p. 69).
* Enbridge has a history of problems with integrity management (p. 70).
* PHMSA is not very strict in oversight compared to Coast Guard and EPA (p. 74). Has not held a lot of excercises (p. 76).
* Reponse force incorrectly used sorbent booms (p. 79)?
* Disconnect between PHMSA's expectations and company practice--because there is no safe way of knowing (p. 85).
* Shutting down lines to clean up alarms?
* Operators over time "learned" to ignore the 10-minute restriction, especially in the case of MBS alarm--workarounds or a "culture of deviance" had developed (p. 101).
* I don't think that alcohol testing problem will ever be resolved (pp. 101f).
* Sorben boom as token effort (p. 105).
* Staff trained for rivers and creeks, not for "wetland environments, high water, or small creeks with swift moving water" (p. 107).
* Both EPA and Coast Guard are more strict (specific) than PHMSA with regard to response capability standards (p. 109).
* Learning is highly specific--after operators have learned to respond to oil spills on large rivers, they have not yet learned to respond to incidents on small, fast-moving creeks.
* NTSB suggesting that PHMSA is rubber-stamping plans (p. 112).
* What happens after this report is really important--is it possible that the regulator just doesn't respond? In that case, the report would be really ceremonial--is the hard criticism directed at the PHMSA picked up?
* Did Enbridges track record improve after Kalamazoo?
* Is Enbridges growth really the cause of the deterioration of capabilities, or just an excuse?
* Is SMS simply the latest trend (p. 116)? Before, there was that systems stuff.
