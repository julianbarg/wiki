# @Ergene2020

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]], [[Constructivism & Ecology]]_

## One-paragraph summary

First, the article contrasts the [[critical|critical approach to sustainability]] and the [[managerial approach to climate change]]. Then, the article suggests four shifts that research should take to elevate _socio-ecological wellbeing_ to the highest priority--and for an _ecological case for business_ to replace the business case for sustainability. (1) Returning to a tired debate to move the research community from **managerial to critical epistemologies**. (2) Moving from realist to relational ontologies that emphasize the relationship between the planet, ecosystems, and people while rejecting a human-nature dualism [@Purser1995]. (3) A shift to interdisciplinary research. (4) Moving toward engaged scholarship rather than taking a value-neutral approach. The article closes with a passionate plea for us to save our species.
