## One-paragraph summary

Nonprofits tackle income inequality on the local level, but they compete for resources. The local fabric matters for their effectiveness in reducing income inequality, but resource competition can hamper their effectiveness. I don't like that they treat local nonprofits as the main factor to determine income inequality. Another oversight is empirically--reducing income inequality is not equally easy at every level. I have a bunch of criticisms of this paper. How did Figure 1 come to be? Is it based on the data or the model? It cannot be based on the model, because it is a fixed effect model--the absolute range of the gini coefficient is from 0 to 1, but the model only captures its change over time, which we would expect to be much, much smaller.
