* This might actually help me with my work. Weick states that under conditions where the input is stable, traditional learning can occur. But he emphasizes that this is rarely the case. This applies to pipelines. Incident chances that arrive at a constant rate can be thwarted off. Technology serves to stability the stimulus situation.
* *Nonlearning situations--routines--can be evidence of previous learning*. Let's say there is an industry-wide change, and one organization does not react. Initially this would occur to be nonlearning, but what if the situation changes back? Or if the organization managed to attain a valuable "traditionalist" label?
