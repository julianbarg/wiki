## One-page summary
Priem and Butler (2001) introduce and answer two questions: 1) Is the RBV a theory? 2) Is the RBV useful for building an understanding in strategic management? To answer the first question, the authors use three hurdles that a "view" must pass to become a "theory": general theories 1) are generalized conditionals 2) have empirical content and 3) exhibit nomic necessity.  

The first criterion is simple in that the RBV’s main argument can be explained with if/then statements (e.g. if a firm attribute is VRIN, then that attribute is a resource leading the firm to possess sustained competitive advantage). The authors, however, point out that the problem starts with the second criterion. The arguments need to be synthetic statements, which we can decide whether they are true or false after empirical testing, rather than analytic statements, which are always true because the way they are defined. Considering the main statement “valuable and rare resources can be a source of competitive advantage”, the authors argue that the statement is *tautological* in that the term *"valuable" is defined in terms of competitive advantage*, and vice versa. They, thus, contend that the RBV fails to meet the second condition. Third, since nomic necessity means that the relationship between IV and DV cannot be by chance, the authors argue that scholars may not build hypothesis coming from the spurious relationship between two, which is not supported by a logical link. Then, the author suggests the below-mentioned solution to overcome "definitional dependence" problems. Figure 1 of Barney (1991), they argue, purposely ignores that the value of resources is sometimes determined solely by both the opportunities and threats existing in the external environment (product markets, not factor markets).  

For the second question, they raise a number of debatable issues. The RBV has failed to give implication to practitioners as well as researchers because 1) The RBV has a low level of the operational validity due to the four attributes of resource (VRIN) (Thomas and Tymon, 1982), 2) the framework cannot solve the “black box” problem that the value is exogenously determined in the product market, and 3) The standard of resource characteristics is still ambiguous (Lippman and Rumelt, 1982). Not only that, 4) the boundaries that the RBV can explain need to be determined to improve its operational validity. 5) Even though the RBV has been started with a dynamic approach that emphasizes “change” over time (Derickx & Cool, 1989; Penrose, 1959; Wernerfelt, 1984), most of the subsequent work is based on a static concept. 

This paper, I think, made a great contribution in the literature of strategic management. Priem and Butler (2001) mainly question how future scholars in the RBV camp define “value”, “resource”, “competitive advantage” to develop the RBV in theoretical as well as practical directions. Since the concepts in the RBV were too ambiguous and broad, this paper suggests that 1) scholars need to measure the value of resources by integrating the demand side into the original resource based view and 2) they need to recategorize resources into subcategories, looking at how each resource is different (its antecedents as well as its consequences) from other resources (the knowledge based view is one of the directions they suggest).
