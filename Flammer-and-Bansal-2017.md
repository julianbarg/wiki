## One-paragraph summary
Flammer and Bansal (2017) explores a potential time-based agency problem between managers and shareholders. This constitutes a contribution to the research of temporal orientation on the *organizational* level (as opposed to the *individual* level), by examining the effects of long-term incentives. Flammer and Bansal (2017) propose that managers' discount rates are higher than shareholders. Managers personally benefit most from short-run benefits, whereas investors can benefit from long-run benefits also. If this misalignment is alleviated, the firm value should increase immediately (**H1a**), and its operating performance should improve in the long-term (**H1b**). As potential mechanisms, the authors propose increased investment in innovation (**H2a**) and an increased engagement of stakeholders (**H2b**).

To test their hypotheses, Flammer and Bansal (2017) carry out a discontinuity analysis. The condition they test are shareholder proposals that introduce long-term incentive packages for managers (taking the quasi-random range of proposals that gain between 49.9% and 50.1% support).


They find that managers
