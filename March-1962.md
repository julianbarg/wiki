## Notes

### One-page summary
This article by March lays out his research agenda. The article does away with some of the commonplace assumptions in management science - specifically, the assumption of profit maximizing firms, and the "classic economic description of the firm as an entrepreneurs" (ibid. 675). Rather, March draws on concepts from the sphere of political science, such as power, coalitions, and (goal) conflicts. One purpose of the article is to encourage political scientists to study organizations, such as business, and develop consistent theories that describe their behavior. 

The more interesting, and relevant takeaway from the article is however the message it sends to management scholars. March describes the phenomena and theoretical fragments related to what would later be known as the Behavioral Theory of the Firm. Firms do not merely maximize profits. Instead, the organization consists of multiple groups (which, as he acknowledges, might also consist of groups or individuals themselves - this entails further problems which March also discusses). The firm as a political coalition needs to negotiate the goal of the organization - it is not given.

Because organizational behavior is given by its nature as a coalition, management scholars should not only pay attention to owners or CEOs. And they should acknowledge the "non-uniqueness of short run solutions to the coalition problem" (ibid. 674). Multiple viable pathways for an organization to move forward may exist, and the economics-based profit maximization approaches of management scholars got it wrong. Lastly, some parts of the organizational behavior might be "given". These givens may include institutionalized commitments, or a status quo achieved though indoctrination.

### Important sentences/observations
* "The individual is treated as the system in some cases (e.g., in learning) and as the elementary unit in other (e.g., studies of small groups). Similarly, small groups are treated both as systems and as elementary units (e.g., in studies of organizations). Since the first postulate of conflict is essentially that the basic units themselves not be conflict systems, it seems awkward to be able to view a single system as either an elementary unit or a conflict system depending on the level of aggregation involved" (ibid. 664).
* "In many resepcts, March and Simon, Thompson, and Cyert and March view the business organization as a socio-political conflict system subject to economic constraints" (ibid. 666).
* "The usual objection to the imputation of a superordinate goal to conflict systems other than the human organism (or perhaps animals generally) is a curious one. Any such effort bears the onus of anthropomorphism" (ibid. 667).
* "The economic theory of the firm is almost invariably constructed by explicitly imputing a superordinate goal to the con-flict system represented by a business firm." (ibid., 669).
* **->** "For the most part, the theory suppresses as outside its domain the process by ordering is as outside its domain the process by which an organization composed of a rather complex mixture of people with considerable heterogeneity of individual goals generates a single preference ordering. This implicit assumption that the firm represents a conflict system susceptible to useful description in terms of a superordinate goal (whether profit maximization or some other) is shared by most economists. It is apparently convenient for the construction of (whether profit maximization or some other) is shared by most economists. It is apparently convenient[...]. Nevertheless, the assumption is almost certainly wrong as a micro-description of a business firm." (ibid., 669).
* "Generally speaking, profit maximization can be made perfectly meaningful (with some but when made meaningful, it usually turns out to be invalid as a description of firm behavior" (ibid., 670).
* "Basically, we assume that a business firm is a political coalition
and that the executive in the firm is a political broker. The composition of the firm is not given; it is negotiated. The goals of the firm are not given; they are bargained" (ibid., 672).
* "Each potential participant makes demands on system. These demands are essentially the price required for in the coalition" (ibid., 673).
