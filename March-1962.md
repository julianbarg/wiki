## Notes

### Important sentences/observations
* "The individual is treated as the system in some cases (e.g., in learning) and as the elementary unit in other (e.g., studies of small groups). Similarly, small groups are treated both as systems and as elementary units (e.g., in studies of organizations). Since the first postulate of conflict is essentially that the basic units themselves not be conflict systems, it seems awkward to be able to view a single system as either an elementary unit or a conflict system depending on the level of aggregation involved" (ibid. 664).
* "In many resepcts, March and Simon, Thompson, and Cyert and March view the business organization as a socio-political conflict system subject to economic constraints" (ibid. 666).
* "The usual objection to the imputation of a superordinate goal to conflict systems other than the human organism (or perhaps animals generally) is a curious one. Any such effort bears the onus of anthropomorphism" (ibid. 667).
* "The economic theory of the firm is almost invariably constructed by explicitly imputing a superordinate goal to the con-flict system represented by a business firm." (ibid., 669).
* **->** "For the most part, the theory suppresses as outside its domain the process by ordering is as outside its domain the process by which an organization composed of a rather complex mixture of people with considerable heterogeneity of individual goals generates a single preference ordering. This implicit assumption that the firm represents a conflict system susceptible to useful description in terms of a superordinate goal (whether profit maximization or some other) is shared by most economists. It is apparently convenient for the construction of (whether profit maximization or some other) is shared by most economists. It is apparently convenient[...]. Nevertheless, the assumption is almost certainly wrong as a micro-description of a business firm." (ibid., 669).
* "Generally speaking, profit maximization can be made perfectly meaningful (with some but when made meaningful, it usually turns out to be invalid as a description of firm behavior" (ibid., 670).
* "Basically, we assume that a business firm is a political coalition
and that the executive in the firm is a political broker. The composition of the firm is not given; it is negotiated. The goals of the firm are not given; they are bargained" (ibid., 672).
* "Each potential participant makes demands on system. These demands are essentially the price required for in the coalition" (ibid., 673).
