# @Boisot2010

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]], [[Constructivism & Ecology]]_

## One-paragraph summary

@Boisot2010 is giving a good overview over the divergence of assumptions between Modernism and Postmodernism--if maybe a partial one, leaving out calls e.g, for multivocality in service of justice in Postmodern works. The first model in the paper--W & O vs. W & O & L--is the most effectie. Postmodernity does not assume the observer as objective or neutral--the postmodern approach is to consider observer and the observed (world) in the context of where the observers is social situated.
