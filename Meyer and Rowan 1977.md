## One-page summary
In this paper, the authors challenge the assumption underlying the theories of formal organizational structure prevailing at the time, which is the assumption that the ‘coordination and control of activity are the critical dimensions on which formal organizations have succeeded in the modern world’ (pg.342). The authors realize that the above assumption is based on the view that activities within an organization occur according to their structure and follow the ‘prescriptions’ set out by the formal structure of the organization. However, inconsistent with the prevailing theories and the underlying assumption, empirical evidence finds that there exists a gap between formal and the inform organization, and structures and activities are only loosely linked. Recognizing this anomaly, the authors develop a theory of institutionalized structure and ceremonial rules that are independent of technical needs and efficiency demands that organizations face. Furthermore, the authors argue that since these institutionalized, ceremonial structures are often inconsistent with efficiency, they often avoid coordination and control, and result in decoupling of formal structure and informal activities within organizations. 

In this theoretical framework, rationalized formal structures are largely generated from institutional myths which result from various social forces such as public opinion, views of important constituents, educational system, social prestige, laws, and others. These institutional myths are manifestations of powerful institutional rules that bind particular organizations. These myths have two key properties: 1) they specify (in a rulelike way) appropriate ways to pursue technical purposes, and 2) they are highly institutionalized and are beyond the discretion of any individual or an organization. Since the myths are independent of environmental needs and efficiency concerns, they end up pushing firms in the directions that is over and above the level required by efficiency concerns. Furthermore, the authors argue three specific processes that generate rationalized myths of organizational structure: 1) the elaboration of complex relational networks, 2) the degree of collective organization of the environment, and 3) leadership effects of local organizations. The institutional myths and the resulting isomorphic pressure result in three organizational consequences: 1) incorporating elements for legitimacy reasons, rather than efficiency, 2) adopting ceremonial assessment criteria, and 3) reducing turbulence and maintaining stability through dependence on external institutions.  

While discussing institutionalized structures and organizational activities, the authors acknowledge the importance of efficiency as a source of rationalized formal structures as they argue that rationalized formal structures arise in two context, one where organization’s local relational networks demand certain structures and thus resulting in efficiency rationale, and the other where the institutionalized myths and resulting norms drive the adoption of certain structure, thus resulting in legitimacy and stability rationale. Then the authors outline conditions that are likely to lead to efficiency driven structures (organizations using routine, clearly defined technologies, with outputs easily evaluated), and conditions that are likely to lead to legitimacy driven structures (variable, ambiguous technologies with outputs difficult to appraise).  

Finally, the authors outline two possible sources of structural inconsistencies in institutionalized organizations: 1) conflicts with efficiency, and 2) conflicts with institutional rules of different parts of the environment. These conflicts make concern for efficiency, coordination, and control problematic. Firms facing these inconsistencies can decouple their structure from activities and from each other, use confidence and good faith of institutionalized structures, and use ceremonial inspection and evaluations to evaluate their structure. By highlighting the role of institutionalized myths and ceremonial rules in influencing the formal structure of organizations, and their potential inconsistency with efficiency demands, the authors provide a new way to view rationalized formal structures, and the apparent decoupling of structures and activities within organizations.
