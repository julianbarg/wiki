# @March2006

## One-paragraph summary

Contrasting the ideals of rational redicion making and the observed limits to rationality. First part, showing how common rational models are and some common critique. Second part, introducing feedback-based adaption. March makes clear that innovation stems from the same source as error--with the caveat that successful innovation increases the chance of survival, even when it only occurs over the long run. But March also states that "unintended exploration [...] seems clearly to produce more disasters than it produces glories of successful discovery" (p. 208).

## Notes
* Follows the same structure as [[Levinthal & March 1993]] and [[March, Sproull & Tamuz 1991]]
* "[I]n a long-term and global perspective, the threats to survival posed by the disasters of rational technologies applied to complex situations are less than those posed by failure to discover and exploit the beneficial ideas generated by the technologies" (p. 211)
