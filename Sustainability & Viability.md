_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

Use the language of sustainability/viabilidity [@Springett2003] to illustrate reliability/validity to another audience. Operating a coal power plant may not be sustainable in the long term, but for now it is viable--there are coal power plants being operated right now. That is because the operators rely on reliable knowledge. Valid knowledge might tell us that it is a bad idea, but politics and the broader population would not disagree or stop the operation of those plants.

* Link to: @Levy1997
* Suggested titles: 
    * "Nobody cares what's sustainable: a science and technology study (SDS) on thirty years of sustainability research"
    * "You're right that's not sustainable... nobody cares! Reliable and valid knowledge"
* Compare worsening environmental conditions with stagnant discourse
* Make link to Luhman or Habermas on viability--if it exists then it must be viable. An autopoietic system. 
* Contrast boardroom--reliable and often self-fulfilling--with research--valid and little impact.
