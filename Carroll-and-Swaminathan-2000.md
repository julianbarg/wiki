### Contribution 
This paper explains why and how specialists such as microbreweries emerged after generalists such as mass-production brewing companies had dominated the whole beer industry with the resource-partitioning model of organizational ecology. This paper has two contributions towards organizational ecology. First, under specific boundary conditions, the authors show a dynamic relationship between generalists and specialists, explaining the sequential occurrence of mass-production brewing companies’ market concentration and the emergence of specialty brewers. In original niche theory in Hannan & Freeman (1977), the authors only look at the interaction between organizations and their environment. Thus, two organization forms such as generalists and specialists are not supposed to interact each other, each of forms selected out by the environmental condition. Second, the authors suggest new “identity” mechanism of the resource-partitioning model. In mature U.S. beer industry after a fierce scale-based selection, new high-status specialist niche for microbreweries was created and in full flourish. Even though major breweries tried to occupy the niche, microbreweries could grow constantly because consumers thought major breweries and microbreweries were different in terms of their identities. In other words, the beer market was “partitioned”. Originating from this paper, I think “identity” has become one important factor that divides market segments or resource spaces where firms locate.  

### Summary 
First, to show generalists’ market concentration, the author explains crowding phenomenon among organizations, assuming that there are generalists and specialists competing each other. First, generalists, occupying the market center out-compete specialists, occupying small spot in the resource space’s periphery. However, as market concentration rises, specialists will have the opportunity to occupy thin locations which generalists do not have their eyes on.  

**H1**: market concentration ratio → the founding rate of specialist orgs (+) / mortality rate of specialist orgs (-) 

This is because generalists usually focus on each other because of scale-based selection pressure.  

**H2**: distance from larger competitors on a size gradient → org mortality rate (+) 

Of course, generalists that own high quality products check specialists. Yet, under resource partitioning based on “identity”, a group of specialists already established their identity advantage with the legitimation process. 

**H3**: org form density → the legitimating effects of specialist org form (+) 

Consequently, both specialists and generalists tend to occupy distinct (partitioned) resource niches. In setting of the U.S. beer industry, the authors found the empirical support of their hypotheses.
