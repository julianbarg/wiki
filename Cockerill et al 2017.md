# @Cockerill2017

_Back to [[Barg & Zbaracki]]_

* Kritan Cockerill of the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies, Appalachian State University

## One-paragrah summary

The first two chapters are carrying the book. The first chapter discusses "Sollutionism", the illusion that scientific advancements allow us to perfectly control the environment (see also [[Enligthenment]] and [[human-nature dualism]]). Every natural disaster then becomes a failure of science. The chapter is insightfull, if too drawn out and often redundant. The second chapter introduces examples from Cockerill's field (river management). Cockerill shows that science has had very little bearing on the actual development of waterways in the US, and shows a few moments in history where the scientific community was actually quite uncertain regarding the best course of action. The most illustrative examples is that of damming rivers and subsequent renaturalization. On the one hand, Cockerill shows that the damming of the rivers has not lead to the desired level of control. On the other hand, she rejects the notion that simply turning on our heels and removing damms will not lead to the river being wild again. Rather, the "health" of the river is a is a third dimension and to accomplish it requirs more complex action. The public meanwhile is shown to be largely unable to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy rivers.
