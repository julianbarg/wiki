## One-paragraph summary

This paper introduces the concepts of [[reliability & validity]] by applying them to the sustainability literature. We show that many of the misunderstandings between authors can be resolved--or at least pin-pointed--by applying the two dimensions: [[reliability & validity]]. We show that a lot of papers of the extant (non-business or interdisciplinary) literature focus on high validity knowledge--they attempt to describe an impact on the natural environment as precisely as possible. A smaller subset of studies also focuses on high reliability or high reliability/high validity knowledge--trying to determine public perception and gain simple insights on the consequences for the environment. The complexity of social-ecological systems makes this class of research very difficulty though [@Reyers2018]. A meta-discussion on research in ecology is ongoing [e.g, @Latour1998;@Newton2002;@Ergene2020]. That debate is largely fruitless however, because the point of discontent is by and large the priority that should be given to humanity's needs vis-Ã -vis the natural environment. Deliberation of reliability and validity suggests a more fruitious approach: to take prevailing societal understandings of the human-nature relationship as a reference point when considering when conducting research on the environment. That includes in particular research on "hard" barriers with regard to mitigating environmental impacts.
