2015 | April | 12   | Clinton announces presidential campaign
</br>|       | 19   | Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook raises KXL question: "The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?". The team discusses avoidance tactics: "[...] if we want to have her express skepticism we can do so through a spox [spokesperson] answer to question, using our QA" [@Brian2015].
</br>|       | 22   | Clinton campaign discusses delaying a statement until May Congress recess [@Sullivan2015]
</br>| May   | 10   | Sanders uses KXL to differentiate himself: "I'm not quite sure Hillary Clinton has come out with a position on that" [@Kaplan2015]. The comment enters the Clinton campaign's news review the next day [@Phillips2015a].
</br>|       | 14   | Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, criticizes Clinton on KXL "[Sanders has] been the most consistent and proactive voice in the entire Keystone fight" [@Adler2015]. The comment enters the Clinton campaign's news review the next day [@Phillips2015].

</br>|       | 25   | Clinton team still discusses KXL. "'[Option] (1) Don't comment and hope it goes away' [...] 'Or option 3 - lean into this to send a wink-wink to enviros while she continues to give her non-answer'" [@Ferguson2015].
</br>|       | 27   | Clinton presents her climate plan. When asked about KXL: "I will refrain from commenting [...]" [@Foran2015]. Environmental groups positive reception of her plan is overshadowed by their concern over KXL [@Miller2015].

[...] 'We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the President in public'" [@Schwerin2015]. At the same time, the stance is impacted by the unfolding Hillary Clinton email controversy: "We could even have her come out against Keystone on Monday as well (not sure where that stands), which will solicit criticism but that might help distract from emails" [@Palmieri2015].

</br>|       | 22   | Clinton campaign prepares op-ed "that should help soften the blow to the [NATBU] of the KXL" decision". The statement suggests pipeline safety measures to create work for specific unions (see [[Quotes|Application suspension episode#pipeline-safety-unions]]).

## Narrative

### Additional dimension: Clinton email leak

Where originally, the pressure of environmentalists on Clinton made the defeat of KXL seem more likely, the leak of Clinton's emails ironically inverted this effect slightly. The brought to light the calculative approach that Clinton took with regard to the issue. Commentators saw her move in a new light: The calculative approach confirmed in the eyes of commentators the impression that Clinton was less of a woman of conviction, and more of a untrostworthy populist (needs references/triangulation). The leak had an effect of cancelling out the positiv effect she seeked to gain from the original move. Finally, the "meta dimension" of the issue seems to have paralized the Clinton campaign itself--"do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?" [@Brian2015]. Members of the campaign spend weeks deliberating on how to come into the open with their position on KXL.
