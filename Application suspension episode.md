# Application suspension episode

[[_TOC_]]

* Back to [[KXL episodes]]
* [[Clinton email tables]]

## Narrative

On November 3, 2015 TransCanada asks the State Department to suspend the permit application for its KXL permit application, a move that a White House speaker calls "unusual" [@Chiacu2015]--likely an understatement. The move highlights the extraordinary uncertainty faced by KXL. At the time, the pipeline had been under review for over half a decade. In 2012, the Department of State rejected the project for technical reasons, and TransCanada resubmited the application months later (see [[timeline|Application suspension episode#timeline]]). Previous environmental impact statements by the State Department had looked positive. However, in the second half of 2014 the oil price halfs, from over \\\$100 to about \\\$50. Cue unexpected consequences. On Febuary 4, 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asks the State Department to revisit their analysis [@Harder2015]. Not to worry--the EPA had reanalysed KXL before, without changing the final outcome [@Goodman2014]. But the changed data basis now is a cause for concern. Before the price drop, transportation cost were a negligable factor for the Canadian oil sands industry. Now, the construction of KXL could make the difference between oil fields in Canada being developed or not--the calculated climate impacts of KXL could look significantly worse.

TransCanada's request for the application to be suspended higlights TransCanada's agency in the discourse--beyond the provision of narratives, beyond translation, and beyond reconciliation and challenging of the existing discourse [references necessary or is this reference clear?]. Rather, the organization reaches into the realm of networks and coalitions--playing up the chance that a subsequent administration will be more KXL-friendly. Note that the strategic step itself becomes part of the discourse. The company does not respond to an existing thread in an established channel, for instance by providing documents for an environmental impact analysis or responding to critics. Nonetheless, there are written records of this step that are part of the discourse.

To understand why TransCanada takes the step of asking for a suspension of their permit application, the application needs to be viewed in the context networks and coalitions with different goals and interests. Throughout the year 2015, the importance of the 2016 presidential election for KXL becomes increasingly clear. The 2015 Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act marks a bipartisan starting point. In January, 2015 the act is passed by the House of Congress and by the Senate, both times with votes from both Republicans and Democrats. On February 24, 2015 though, the bill is vetoed by President Obama, who argues--being the legal scholar that he is--that the bill would circumvent the "longstanding and proven" [@Obama2015] national interest determination process (TransCanada should have taken note of this concern--the two permits later issued by his successor Trump were both bogged down by lawsuits claiming improper procedure).

<!--The result of the 2016 presidential election is a perfect exhibit of the need to attend to coalitions and their often emergent nature. Trump--the only Republican candidate to somewhat diverge from the staunch Keystone XL-friendly agenda of the field (Application suspension episode#president-presidential-candidates-position-on-kxl)--drops this rhetoric at once when taking office, and delivers a positive national intestest determination within 3 months.-->
For a demonstration of the relevance of networks and coalitions for the analysis of discourse, one needs to only look as far as to the eventual success of the resubmitted permit application after the 2016 election (which TransCanada eluded to with the suspension request). The eventual approval of the resubmitted permit application is the outcome of extensive efforts to create fossil fuel-friendly networks [@Farrell2016]. The documents approval itself enters the discourse as a document supporting the legitimacy of Keystone XL which pipeline opponents subsequently have to "battle" in court. The following paragraphs provide a more *introspecive* example of the interdependence of networks and discourse to demonstrate mechanisms.

At the outset, a quick note on the field of candidates for the 2016 election. By attending to the candidates and their discourse on KXL one can trace how the plan of suspending or resubmitting the application emerged. As the section on the [[Clinton campaign and KXL|Application suspension episode#clinton-campaign-and-kxl]] and the accompanying [[timeline|Application suspension episode#timeline]] highlight, after the president vetoes the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act on Feb 24, 2015 rumors that the president would reject the KXL permit application become more and more frequent. The rumors claim specific dates for the decision which are repeatedly proven wrong--the incumbent president finally rejects the application on Nov 7, four days after TransCanada requests the suspension. Before the rejection it emerges over time that the KXL application might have to be resubmitted and approved by the subsequent administration--a *potential* ally. The resubmission eventually takes place in 2017. A TransCanada employee confirms that the company consideres this course of action with CBC on August 9, 2015--notably, this "confirmation" of facts again takes on the form of a rumor as the story did not name its source. 

Another sidenote on rumors: the rumors highlighted here are just that--rumors. Documents that feature the rumors include news reports, emails that reach smaller or wider cicles, and interviews or other conversations. The rumors have to be considered in a discourse analysis, because the documents that feature these rumors *are* part of the discourse on KXL. Rumors have a strong influence on the internal discourse of the Clinton campaign and their outward discursive actions--or lack thereof (see next section). And rumors--so the rumor--influenced the discursive actions of TransCanada, too.

Despite the bipartisan nature of the Keyston XL Pipeline Approval Act in January 2015, KXL does eventually prove to be a partisan issue--as far as the 2016 presidential election is concerned. For the longest time, it is not clear who would be the Republican nominee, but throughout the year 2015 all candidates speak out in support of KXL (see table on [[candidates and positions|Application suspension episode#president-presidential-candidates-position-on-kxl]] and [[polls timeline|Application suspension episode#republican-primaries-timeline]]). On the Democrat side, the field of contestants is much thinner. Bernie Sanders had been an outspoken critics of KXL for years. Hillary Clinton on the other hand had last spoken on KXL in 2010, when she was Secretary of State:

> [W]e've not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so and we are for several reasons -- going back to one of your original questions -- we're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada.
>
> --@Clinton2010

*Take note* of the uncertainty even in that statement. Notably, in the [[full remarks|https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/10/149542.htm]] Clinton never once refers to KXL. Rather, she takes a question on the Alberta Clipper pipeline--which was placed in service half a year before the remarks. Clinton then makes the above remarks that all observers assume refers to KXL. In 2015, after she announces her candidacy, Clinton is frequently pressed to take a stance on KXL, which emerges as one of the most controversial election issues (both KXL *and* her stance). From TransCanada's perspective, under a future Republican president, chances would be that the pipeline would be approved. Under both a future Democratic president or the current president, KXL's fate would be *truly* uncertain. That is *until* the Clinton campaign finaly takes a stance on September 22, 2015 (see [[timeline|Application suspension episode#timeline]]). 

### KXL from a Clinton campaign perspective

The previous section laid out the field of potential intervenors from the perspective of TransCanada. For a period of time, the major source of uncertainty is the Clinton campaign--the only party in the cohort not to take a position. In 2016 when WikiLeaks released thousands of her campaigns emails the world received some insight into why the Clinton campaign did not take a stance. From the emails we can learn about the Clinton campaign's potential and realized allies and how they affect the teams *discursive actions*. The emails also provide us with a more fine-grained and visceral experience of participating in a social world. The events laid out below take place in 2015 starting on April 12 when Clinton announces her campaign. Although the temporal dimension is omitted in this section, it matters insofar as from the Clinton campaign's point of view processes and concerns become more clear over time, culminating in her statements on September 22:

> I think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone pipeline as what I believe it is – a distraction from important work we have to do on climate change. And unfortunately from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward with all the other issues. Therefore I oppose it.
>
> --Clinton on September 22, 2015 [@Bradner2015]

The emails show frequent considerations of the "logistics" of taking a stance in a discourse. There are seven dimensions that the campaign considers before taking a stance. **(1)**There are potential and realized allies and adversary, whereby the realization of an ally--for instance through an official endorsement or donation--provides one temporal element. **(2)** The team monitors the discourse as it partains to KXL and the Clinton campaign. Most importantly, the campaign has some ideas of how the discourse may develop in the future, but with significant uncertainty--think the abovementioned rumors. The release of new information--uncertain or not--is another temporal element.
<!--There are *more* or *less* certain information--e.g., the abovementioned rumors--that are part of the discourse studied by the campaign, which in turn influences the campaign's discursive actions. The release of new information is another temporal element. -->
**(3)** The campaign shows extensive considerations around the topic of maximizing the effect of their participation in discourse. **(4)** The emails highlight introspective and consideration around identity and morals before participation in the discourse. **(5)** The emails indicate that the drafting of a compromise is--or at least can be--an inherently cynical process that is concerned not as much with subject matter as it is with interests and trade-offs. In other words, an actor can create the letter of a compromise without supporting the spirit. **(6)** The team, the public, and other actors monitor and compare the stance of e.g., competitors with the stance the Clinton campaign. **(7)** The emails show attempts to signal a position to certain groups without explicitly taking a position--a "quantum position" if you would like.

<!--The emails make frequent references to unions
The emails feature rumors regarding the president that cause Hillary to hold of
The emails consider how statements make maximum effect
The emails philosophize on the very nature of taking a stance
The emails show *compromise* as a very cynical natured action--not as adopting a foreign position
Can the cynical nature of compromise be shaken off as discourse becomes baked into more future discourse?
Identity-->

<!--Lie idle-->

<!--Public information are limited about what TransCanada plotted and how it viewed the field ahead of their decision to ask for the permit application to be suspended. "A source involved in the project" [@Panetta2015] let the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation know that TransCanada had learned by August 2015 that a permit rejection was imminent, and that TransCanada planned to either reapply, or file a suit under the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement--both of which TransCanada subsequently did. The request to suspend the application shows that TransCanada viewed their chances as better under the future administration--which proved true, other than for the unexpected consequences of the new administrations botched permit approval. -->

<!--* The reality of compromise
* The wildcard Trump--the art of botchering a deal--got it!
* The limits to agency--unexpected consequences--touch on it!
* Rumors influence statements and decisions--touch on it!-->

### Additional dimension: Clinton email leak

Where originally, the pressure of environmentalists on Clinton made the defeat of KXL seem more likely, the leak of Clinton's emails ironically inverted this effect slightly. The brought to light the calculative approach that Clinton took with regard to the issue. Commentators saw her move in a new light: The calculative approach confirmed in the eyes of commentators the impression that Clinton was less of a woman of conviction, and more of a untrostworthy populist (needs references/triangulation). The leak had an effect of cancelling out the positiv effect she seeked to gain from the original move. Finally, the "meta dimension" of the issue seems to have paralized the Clinton campaign itself--"do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?" [@Brian2015]. Members of the campaign spend weeks deliberating on how to come into the open with their position on KXL.

> 4. Could we beef up the mentioning jobs? O'Malley made the mistake with the trades of stating that energy jobs are temporary. They really bristle at that. Could we mention that these are "jobs and careers" for many workers and as we transition HRC wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word.
