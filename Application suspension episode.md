2010 | Oct   | 20   | Secretary of State Clinton "inclined" to approve KXL
2015 | April | 12   | Clinton announces presidential campaign
</br>|       | 19   | Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook raises KXL question: "The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?". The team discusses avoidance tactics: "[...] if we want to have her express skepticism we can do so through a spox [spokesperson] answer to question, using our QA" [@Brian2015].
</br>|       | 22   | Clinton campaign discusses delaying a statement until May Congress recess [@Sullivan2015]
</br>| May   | 10   | Sanders uses KXL to differentiate himself: "I'm not quite sure Hillary Clinton has come out with a position on that" [@Kaplan2015]. The comment enters the Clinton campaign's news review the next day [@Phillips2015a].
</br>|       | 14   | Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, criticizes Clinton on KXL "[Sanders has] been the most consistent and proactive voice in the entire Keystone fight" [@Adler2015]. The comment enters the Clinton campaign's news review the next day [@Phillips2015].
</br>|       | 18   | Clinton campaign "heard a rumor that a decision could come as early as this Thursday" and prepares a reaction [@Ogden2015]
</br>| June  | 04   | Candidate Perry in his announcement speech: "On day one, I will also sign an executive order approving the construction of the Keystone Pipeline." [@Perry2015]
</br>| July  | 10   | In a non-public email, League of Conservation Voters suggests edits to Clinton campaign responses in LCV questionnaire: "it’s hard to imagine we can move forward [with an endorsement] until [Hillary] makes clear she now opposes KXL" [@Sullivan2015a]
</br>|       | 25   | Clinton team still discusses KXL. "'[Option] (1) Don't comment and hope it goes away' [...] 'Or option 3 - lean into this to send a wink-wink to enviros while she continues to give her non-answer'" [@Ferguson2015].
</br>|       | 27   | Clinton presents her climate plan. When asked about KXL: "I will refrain from commenting [...]" [@Foran2015]. Environmental groups positive reception of her plan is overshadowed by their concern over KXL [@Miller2015].
</br>|       | 28   | Sanders attacks Clinton on KXL: "It is hard for me to understand how one can be concerned about climate change but not vigorously oppose the Keystone pipeline" [@Strauss2015].
</br>| Aug   | 06   | Clinton team considers KXL statement at Colbert Show in Oct [@Schaka2015], later that day it is "in a holding pattern again on KXL" [@Sullivan2015b]
</br>|       | 07   | The final stance is still being discussed: "'is she coming out against Keystone XL?' [...] 'We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the President in public'" [@Schwerin2015]. At the same time, the stance is impacted by the unfolding Hillary Clinton email controversy: "We could even have her come out against Keystone on Monday as well (not sure where that stands), which will solicit criticism but that might help distract from emails" [@Palmieri2015].
</br>|       | 09   | CBC News talks to a source inside TransCanada. TransCanada believes rejection is imminent, considers NAFTA lawsuit or re-filing application after election [@Panetta2015].
</br>|       | 14   | Clinton team shares rumors that president will deny KXL on a Aug 24 or 25. "well [sic] this would be great" [@Schwerin2015a].
</br>|       | 19   | Chair of Clinton campaign Podesta: "Now if POTUS would finally kill Keystone all could be good in the kingdom" [@Podesta2015]
</br>|       |      | Clinton criticizes the president's _delay_ on KXL decision
</br>|       | 20   | NABTU reaches out to Clinton campaign regarding a potential decision on KXL by the president four days later. Clinton Labor Outreach Director makes clear that an approving statement by Clinton campaign would endanger union relations [@Budzinski2015].
</br>|       | 22   | Clinton campaign prepares op-ed "that should help soften the blow to the [NABTU] of the KXL decision" [@Budzinski2015]. The statement suggests pipeline safety measures to create work for specific unions (see [[Quotes|Application suspension episode#pipeline-safety-unions]]).
</br>|       | 23   | Rumored date of presidents decision on KXL is now late October. "Maybe they decided to push it until after the Canadian election on 10/19" [@Budzinski2015]. On the potential of KXL op-ed, Clinton campaign Labour Outreach Director remarks: "Ideally to get passed [sic] the Sept 9 meeting with the [NABTU] would be a personal god-send" [@Budzinski2015]. Labour Outreach Director also suggests specific language for the op-ed to appease unions, such as "Careers is their buzz word" [@Budzinski2015].
</br>|       | 27   | The US ambassador to Canada--who had previously worked for TransCanada--notes in an email to Clinton campaign director Podesta that a comment on KXL "could be argued to be intervention in [the Canadian] election" [@Giffin2015].
</br>| Sep   | 07   | Clinton campaign puts off KXL decision again [@Budzinski2015a].
</br>|       | 7-9  | Clinton campaign continues Aug 23 discussion of KXL op-ed. The discussion shows a range of dimensions considered by the team as framings--consistency, developments, climate change, (political) energy and tonality, timing, language, job creation, data as an afterthought. See [[Clinton campaign--KXL dimensions]].
</br>|       | 09   | Clinton meets with NABTU, informs them of anti-KXL stance. LIUNA in particular maintains critical stance: "we should not be surprised if LIUNA still puts out a critical statement in response to our statement when [the op-ed] goes out. [...] You might even notice them reaching out to Republicans, that is for show" [@Budzinski2015b].
</br>|       |      | Clinton campaign drafts new responses to League of Conservative Voters questionnaire from July. The new response is a solid and concise rundown of activists' anti-KXL rhetorics [@Ogden2015a].
</br>|       | 22   | Clinton comes out as opposing KXL
2016 | Oct   | 19   | Canadian federal election

2017 | Jan   | 24   | President signs "Memorandum on Construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline" [@Trump2017]

## Narrative

### Additional dimension: Clinton email leak

Where originally, the pressure of environmentalists on Clinton made the defeat of KXL seem more likely, the leak of Clinton's emails ironically inverted this effect slightly. The brought to light the calculative approach that Clinton took with regard to the issue. Commentators saw her move in a new light: The calculative approach confirmed in the eyes of commentators the impression that Clinton was less of a woman of conviction, and more of a untrostworthy populist (needs references/triangulation). The leak had an effect of cancelling out the positiv effect she seeked to gain from the original move. Finally, the "meta dimension" of the issue seems to have paralized the Clinton campaign itself--"do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?" [@Brian2015]. Members of the campaign spend weeks deliberating on how to come into the open with their position on KXL.

## Quotes

### Pipeline safety--unions

Aug 22, 2015

> 1. *National Infrastructure Bank* – HRC mentioned this in her launch speech but it’s called out more specifically here (positive for all the trades).
>
> 2. *Modernizing our Pipeline System – *A pledge to repair or replace thousands of miles of outdated pipeline by the end of her first term, through a new “Pipeline Partnership” that supports rate relief for states, cities and rural communities that accelerate replacement of outdated pipes (good for LiUNA and UA).
>
> 3. *Increase Rail Safety *– Accelerate the phase-out of outdated tank cars and repair track defects (will create jobs for affiliates with exposure on the tank car manufacturing and track repair fronts, though the Teamsters may be negative if they see it as slowing oil-by-rail volumes).
>
> 4. *Enhance Grid Security* - Provide new tools and resources to states, cities and rural communities to make the investments necessary to improve grid resilience to both cyber-attack and extreme weather events (positive for IBEW).
>
> 5. *Expanding Consumer Choice:* Offer financing tools for grid investments that support the integration of distributed energy resources and for gas pipeline investments that enable households and businesses to switch away from heating oil and other petroleum products (the trades won’t love the distributed energy piece but the expanded natural gas pipeline network to enable replacement of old fuel oil furnaces with natural gas furnaces is positive for LiUNA, UA and the Boilermakers) .
>
> 6. *Transmission Investment:* Ensure the federal government is a partner in getting low-cost wind and other renewable energy to market through improved federal coordination and cooperation with local governments and power companies (positive for IBEW).
>
> 7. *Transportation Funding: *Work with Congress to close corporate tax loopholes and increase invest investment in transportation solutions that expand transit access and reduce congestion, commute times, oil consumption, and pollution (positive for IBEW, ironworkers and other public transit-exposed trades).
>

### Appease unions

Aug 23, 2015

> 2. Could we include the terminology around "current baseload needs" in the current energy economy in both the fact sheet and Op Ed?  This will at least tip the hat to where we are today with the acknowledgement that we are transitioning to green.
>
> 3. When we talk about infrastructure standards, could we please mention prevailing wage and project labor agreements as one good set of standards? 
>
> 4. Could we beef up the mentioning jobs? O'Malley made the mistake with the trades of stating that energy jobs are temporary. They really bristle at that. Could we mention that these are "jobs and careers" for many workers and as we transition HRC wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word.
> 5. As I mention above, the Trades will attack Obama on raising energy prices, could HRC's OpEd and Fact sheet mention that she wants to see protections for consumers for those potential rising prices?
>
