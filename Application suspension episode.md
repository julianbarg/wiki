# Application suspension episode

[[_TOC_]]

## Narrative

On November 3, 2015 TransCanada took the highly unusual step of asking the State Department to suspend the permit application for the KXL application. The move highlights the extraordinary uncertainty faced by KXL. At the time, the pipeline had been under review for over half a decade and resubmitted once. Previous environmental impact statements by the State Department had looked positive. However, in the second half of 2014 the oil price halfed, from over \\\$100 to about \\\$50. Cue unexpected consequences. On Febuary 4, 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked the State Department to revisit their analysis [@Harder2015]. Not to worry--the EPA had done so before, without changing the final outcome [@Goodman2014]. But the changed data basis was reason for concern. Before, transportation cost were a negligable factor for the Canadian oil sands industry. Now, the construction of KXL could make the difference between oil fields in Canada being developed or not--the calculated climate impacts of KXL could look significantly worse.

TransCanada's request for the application to be suspended higlights TransCanada's agency in the discourse beyond the provision of narratives, beyond translation, and beyond reconciliation and challenging of the existing discourse. TransCanada's permit application exists in a network of coalitions with different goals and interests. Throughout the year 2015, the importance of the 2016 presidential election for Keystone XL became increasingly clear. The 2015 Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act could be taken as a litmus test. In January, 2015 the act was passed by the House of Congress and by the Senate, both times with votes from both Republicans and Democrats. On February 24, 2015 though, the bill was vetoed by the President, who argued that the bill would circumvent "longstanding and proven" [@Obama2015] national interest determination. From TransCanada's perspective, under a future Republican president, chances would be that the pipeline would be approved. Under both a future Democratic president or the current president, KXL's fate would be *truly* uncertain. 

Furthermore, an existing negative national interest determination might provide fodder for a future lawsuit by KXL opponents against an approved Keystone XL. This concern proved true when the new Republican administration approved KXL on March 24, 2017 [@Labott2017]--the pipeline was subsequently for two years tied up in lawsuits related to the [[Nebraska LB1161 Episode]] and serious faults in their revision of the prior administration's environmental impact statement [@D.Mon.2018].

Public information are limited about what TransCanada plotted and how it viewed the field ahead of their decision to ask for the permit application to be suspended. "A source involved in the project" [@Panetta2015] let the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation know that TransCanada had learned by August 2015 that a permit rejection was imminent, and that TransCanada planned to either reapply, or file a suit under the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement--both of which TransCanada subsequently did. The request to suspend the application shows that TransCanada viewed their chances as better under the future administration--which proved true, other than for the unexpected consequences of the new administrations botched permit approval. 

Let's briefly map out the field of contestants for the presidential election from Keystone XL from TransCanada's point of view. Above I mentioned the incumbent president--Obama. Obama's State Department had previously been reasonably cooperative, and had also issued

### Additional dimension: Clinton email leak

Where originally, the pressure of environmentalists on Clinton made the defeat of KXL seem more likely, the leak of Clinton's emails ironically inverted this effect slightly. The brought to light the calculative approach that Clinton took with regard to the issue. Commentators saw her move in a new light: The calculative approach confirmed in the eyes of commentators the impression that Clinton was less of a woman of conviction, and more of a untrostworthy populist (needs references/triangulation). The leak had an effect of cancelling out the positiv effect she seeked to gain from the original move. Finally, the "meta dimension" of the issue seems to have paralized the Clinton campaign itself--"do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?" [@Brian2015]. Members of the campaign spend weeks deliberating on how to come into the open with their position on KXL.

Labour Outreach Director also suggests specific language for the op-ed to appease unions, such as "Careers is their buzz word" [@Budzinski2015].
</br>|       | 27   | The US ambassador to Canada--who had previously worked for TransCanada--notes in an email to Clinton campaign director Podesta that a comment on KXL "could be argued to be intervention in [the Canadian] election" [@Giffin2015].

## Quotes

### Pipeline safety--unions

Aug 22, 2015

> 1. *National Infrastructure Bank* – HRC mentioned this in her launch speech but it’s called out more specifically here (positive for all the trades).
>
> 2. *Modernizing our Pipeline System – *A pledge to repair or replace thousands of miles of outdated pipeline by the end of her first term, through a new “Pipeline Partnership” that supports rate relief for states, cities and rural communities that accelerate replacement of outdated pipes (good for LiUNA and UA).
>
> 3. *Increase Rail Safety *– Accelerate the phase-out of outdated tank cars and repair track defects (will create jobs for affiliates with exposure on the tank car manufacturing and track repair fronts, though the Teamsters may be negative if they see it as slowing oil-by-rail volumes).
>
> 4. *Enhance Grid Security* - Provide new tools and resources to states, cities and rural communities to make the investments necessary to improve grid resilience to both cyber-attack and extreme weather events (positive for IBEW).
>
> 5. *Expanding Consumer Choice:* Offer financing tools for grid investments that support the integration of distributed energy resources and for gas pipeline investments that enable households and businesses to switch away from heating oil and other petroleum products (the trades won’t love the distributed energy piece but the expanded natural gas pipeline network to enable replacement of old fuel oil furnaces with natural gas furnaces is positive for LiUNA, UA and the Boilermakers) .
>
> 6. *Transmission Investment:* Ensure the federal government is a partner in getting low-cost wind and other renewable energy to market through improved federal coordination and cooperation with local governments and power companies (positive for IBEW).
>
> 7. *Transportation Funding: *Work with Congress to close corporate tax loopholes and increase invest investment in transportation solutions that expand transit access and reduce congestion, commute times, oil consumption, and pollution (positive for IBEW, ironworkers and other public transit-exposed trades).
>
> -- @Budzinski2015

### Appease unions

Aug 23, 2015

> 2. Could we include the terminology around "current baseload needs" in the current energy economy in both the fact sheet and Op Ed?  This will at least tip the hat to where we are today with the acknowledgement that we are transitioning to green.
>
> 3. When we talk about infrastructure standards, could we please mention prevailing wage and project labor agreements as one good set of standards? 
>
> 4. Could we beef up the mentioning jobs? O'Malley made the mistake with the trades of stating that energy jobs are temporary. They really bristle at that. Could we mention that these are "jobs and careers" for many workers and as we transition HRC wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word.
> 5. As I mention above, the Trades will attack Obama on raising energy prices, could HRC's OpEd and Fact sheet mention that she wants to see protections for consumers for those potential rising prices?
>
> -- @Budzinski2015
