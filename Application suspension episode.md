## Narrative

On November 3, 2015 TransCanada asks the State Department to suspend the permit application for its KXL permit application, a move that a White House speaker calls "unusual" [@Chiacu2015]--likely an understatement. The move highlights the extraordinary uncertainty faced by KXL. At the time, the pipeline had been under review for over half a decade. In 2012, the Department of State rejected the project for technical reasons, and TransCanada resubmited the application months later (see [[timeline|Application suspension episode#timeline]]). Previous environmental impact statements by the State Department had looked positive. However, in the second half of 2014 the oil price halfs, from over \\\$100 to about \\\$50. Cue unexpected consequences. On Febuary 4, 2015 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asks the State Department to revisit their analysis [@Harder2015]. Not to worry--the EPA had reanalysed KXL before, without changing the final outcome [@Goodman2014]. But the changed data basis now is a cause for concern. Before the price drop, transportation cost were a negligable factor for the Canadian oil sands industry. Now, the construction of KXL could make the difference between oil fields in Canada being developed or not--the calculated climate impacts of KXL could look significantly worse.

TransCanada's request for the application to be suspended higlights TransCanada's agency in the discourse--beyond the provision of narratives, beyond translation, and beyond reconciliation and challenging of the existing discourse [references necessary or is this reference clear?]. Rather, the organization reaches into the realm of networks and coalitions--playing up the chance that a subsequent administration will be more KXL-friendly. Note that the strategic step itself becomes part of the discourse--_that is why I am able to write about it_. The company does not respond to an existing thread in an established channel, for instance by providing documents for an environmental impact analysis or responding to critics. Nonetheless, there are written records of this step that are part of the discourse.

To understand why TransCanada takes the step of asking for a suspension of their permit application, the application needs to be viewed in the context of networks and coalitions with diverging goals and interests. Throughout the year 2015, the importance of the 2016 presidential election for KXL becomes increasingly clear. The 2015 Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act marks a bipartisan starting point. In January, 2015 the act is passed by the House of Congress and by the Senate, both times with votes from both Republicans and Democrats. On February 24, 2015 though, the bill is vetoed by President Obama, who argues--being the legal scholar that he is--that the bill would circumvent the "longstanding and proven" [@Obama2015] national interest determination process (TransCanada should have taken note of this concern--the two permits later issued by his successor Trump were both bogged down by lawsuits claiming improper procedure).

<!--The result of the 2016 presidential election is a perfect exhibit of the need to attend to coalitions and their often emergent nature. Trump--the only Republican candidate to somewhat diverge from the staunch Keystone XL-friendly agenda of the field (Application suspension episode#president-presidential-candidates-position-on-kxl)--drops this rhetoric at once when taking office, and delivers a positive national intestest determination within 3 months.-->
For a demonstration of the relevance of networks and coalitions for the analysis of this discourse, one needs to only look as far as to the eventual success of the resubmitted permit application after the 2016 election (which TransCanada eluded to with the suspension request). The eventual approval of the resubmitted permit application is the outcome of extensive efforts to create fossil fuel-friendly networks [@Farrell2016]. The documents approval itself enters the discourse as a document supporting the legitimacy of Keystone XL which pipeline opponents subsequently have to "battle" in court. The following paragraphs provide a more *introspecive* example of the interdependence of networks and discourse to demonstrate mechanisms.

At the outset, a quick note on the field of candidates for the 2016 election. By attending to the candidates and their discourse on KXL one can trace how the plan of suspending or resubmitting the application emerged. As the section on the [[Clinton campaign and KXL|Application suspension episode#clinton-campaign-and-kxl]] and the accompanying [[timeline|Application suspension episode#timeline]] highlight, after the president vetoes the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act on Feb 24, 2015 rumors that the president would reject the KXL permit application become more and more frequent. The rumors claim specific dates for the decision which are repeatedly proven wrong--the incumbent president finally rejects the application on Nov 7, four days after TransCanada requests the suspension. Before the rejection it emerges over time that the KXL application might have to be resubmitted and approved by the subsequent administration--a *potential* ally. The resubmission eventually takes place in 2017. A TransCanada employee confirms that the company consideres this course of action with CBC on August 9, 2015--notably, this "confirmation" of facts again takes on the form of a rumor as the story did not name its source. 

Another footnote on rumors: the rumors highlighted here are just that--rumors. Documents that feature the rumors include news reports, emails that reach smaller or wider cicles, and interviews or other conversations. The rumors have to be considered in a discourse analysis, because the documents that feature these rumors *are* part of the discourse on KXL. Rumors have a strong influence on the internal discourse of the Clinton campaign and their outward discursive actions--or lack thereof (see next section). And rumors--so the rumor--influenced the discursive actions of TransCanada, too.

Despite the bipartisan nature of the Keyston XL Pipeline Approval Act in January 2015, KXL does eventually prove to be a partisan issue--as far as the 2016 presidential election is concerned. For the longest time, it is not clear who would be the Republican nominee, but throughout the year 2015 all candidates speak out in support of KXL (see table on [[candidates and positions|Application suspension episode#president-presidential-candidates-position-on-kxl]] and [[polls timeline|Application suspension episode#republican-primaries-timeline]]). On the Democrat side, the field of contestants is much thinner. Bernie Sanders had been an outspoken critics of KXL for years. Hillary Clinton on the other hand had last spoken on KXL in 2010, when she was Secretary of State:

> [W]e've not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so and we are for several reasons -- going back to one of your original questions -- we're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada.
>
> --@Clinton2010

*Take note* of the uncertainty even in that statement. Notably, in the [[full remarks|https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/10/149542.htm]] Clinton never once refers to KXL. Rather, she takes a question on the Alberta Clipper pipeline--which was placed in service half a year before the remarks. Clinton then makes the above remarks that all observers assume refers to KXL. In 2015, after she announces her candidacy, Clinton is frequently pressed to take a stance on KXL, which emerges as one of the most controversial election issues (both KXL *and* her stance). From TransCanada's perspective, under a future Republican president, chances would be that the pipeline would be approved. Under both a future Democratic president or the current president, KXL's fate would be *truly* uncertain. That is *until* the Clinton campaign finaly takes a stance on September 22, 2015 (see [[timeline|Application suspension episode#timeline]]). 

### KXL from a Clinton campaign perspective

<!--While the data regarding the TransCanada perspective on KXL discourse is thin, a rich public dataset exists on the major moving part and source of uncertainty: in October 2016, just ahead of the Presidential-->
The previous section laid out the field of potential intervenors from the perspective of TransCanada. For a period of time, the major source of uncertainty is the Clinton campaign--the only party in the cohort not to take a position. In 2016 when WikiLeaks released thousands of her campaigns emails the world received some insight into why the Clinton campaign did not take a stance. From the emails we can learn about the Clinton campaign's potential and realized allies and how they affect the teams *discursive actions*. The emails also provide us with a more fine-grained and visceral experience of participating in a social world. The events laid out below take place in 2015 starting on April 12 when Clinton announces her campaign. Although the temporal dimension is omitted in this section, it matters insofar as from the Clinton campaign's point of view processes and concerns become more clear over time, culminating in her statements on September 22:

> I think it is imperative that we look at the Keystone pipeline as what I believe it is – a distraction from important work we have to do on climate change. And unfortunately from my perspective, one that interferes with our ability to move forward with all the other issues. Therefore I oppose it.
>
> --Clinton on September 22, 2015 [@Bradner2015]

The leaked emails showcase how KXL continuously interefered with the Clinton's other policy goals. The Clinton campaign team frequent considers the "logistics" of taking a stance in the KXl discourse. There are seven dimensions that the campaign considers before taking a stance. **(1)**There are potential and realized allies and adversary, whereby the realization of an ally--for instance through an official endorsement or donation--provides one temporal element. **(2)** The team monitors the discourse as it partains to KXL and the Clinton campaign. Most importantly, the campaign has some ideas of how the discourse may develop in the future, but with significant uncertainty--think the abovementioned rumors. The release of new information--uncertain or not--is another temporal element.
<!--There are *more* or *less* certain information--e.g., the abovementioned rumors--that are part of the discourse studied by the campaign, which in turn influences the campaign's discursive actions. The release of new information is another temporal element. -->
**(3)** The campaign shows extensive considerations around the topic of maximizing the effect of their participation in discourse. **(4)** The emails highlight introspective and consideration around identity and morals before participation in the discourse. **(5)** The emails indicate that the drafting of a compromise is--or at least can be--an inherently cynical process that is concerned not as much with subject matter as it is with interests and trade-offs. In other words, an actor can create the letter of a compromise without supporting the spirit. **(6)** The team, the public, and other actors monitor and compare the stance of e.g., competitors with the stance the Clinton campaign. **(7)** The emails show attempts to signal a position to certain groups without explicitly taking a position--a "quantum position" if you would like. Note: where the emails refer to publicly available data, this data is provided rather than references to the emails.

### 1. Allies and adversaries

On April 12, Hillary Clinton announces her run for presidency. Just a week later, the campaign team identifies KXL as a critical issue for her candidacy. Brian Fallon, press secretary: "The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?"--the veto likely referring to the upcoming Keystone XL permit decision (see Section [[Ongoing discourse|Application suspension episode#ongoing-discourse]]). Most of the statements by environmental groups are somewhat vague, but clearly show that their support or opposition to Clinton's presidency hinges on KXL--Jamie Henn of 350.org: "We all remember when Clinton said she was 'inclined' to approve Keystone XL. If the pipeline goes through, she'll shoulder part of the blame, and this protest today will be just a small taste of actions to come" [@Goodman2015]. At least one of the campaign's allies however directly asks the campaign to take a anti-KXL stance in exchange for support in the elections--Tiernan Sittenfeld of the League of Conservation Voters in an email to John Podesta, campaign chair of the Clinton campaign: "[I]t's hard to imagine we [the League of Conservation Voters] can move forward [with an endorsement] until she makes clear she now opposes KXL" [@Sullivan2015a]. See further [[Table on anti-kxl allies and adversaries|Clinton email tables#anti-kxl]].

Other actors constrain the positions a party can take in a discourse. The positions the Clinton campaign takes are not only determined by the merit that stance has in the eyes campaign, but by other parties that the campaign relies on the support of. While environmental groups push for the Clinton campaign to take a stance against KXL, labor unions hope for the pipeline project to be realized. The labor unions point of contact is Nikki Budzinski, who is in charge of labor outreach for the Clinton campaign. The relevant unions are organized collectively in NATBU (North America's Building Trades Unions), a federation of 14 large unions. NATBU represents many of the skilled trades that would benefit from the construction work for KXL. LIUNA (Laborers' International Union of North America) is one union stands out among the federation for actively engaging in the KXL discourse before the lead-up to the 2015. LIUNA arranged for its members to participated in meetings on different administrative levels where they advocate for the approval of KXL, for instance in many of the public meetings in the prior Nebraska episode.

Before in-person talks take place between Hillary Clinton and the building trades unions, the LIUNA makes its position on KXL sufficiently clear ahead of talks between the unions and Clinton competitor O'Malley. After O'Malley voices his opposition to the pipeline, the president of LIUNA writes in an open letter to the Clinton competitor: "[Rejecting KXL is] an attack on the jobs of thousands of members of the Laborers International Union of North America. […] It is absurd pandering to extremist and elitist elements within the environmental movement" [@Eidelson2015]. Subsequently, the Clinton campaign is concerned when drafting statements on KXL: "Can we make sure that [Labor outreach] sees the statement [on KXL] before it goes out? Just want to make sure we don’t catch anyone by surprise. We are so close to getting [an endorsement from building] trades and if we do this right, it will be ok even though they won't like it." 

The Clinton campaign decides not to go through with the statement which would have given a negative stance on KXL. Instead, the team takes advantage of an upcoming meeting with the unions and arranges for Hillary Clinton to disclose their negative stance in said meeting. By delaying the statement and speaking to the unions first, the Clinton campaign avoids the negative respoinse that O'Malley's discursive action had elicited: "The meeting this afternoon with [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and [the building trades unions] went very very well. After the meeting there was a lot of talk about appreciation for her willingness to be candid and up front with them on a difficult issue like KXL. We are on track for other [building] trades [unions'] endorsements in the coming weeks" [@Budzinski2015b]. See further [[Table on pro-KXL groups|Clinton email tables#pro-kxl]].

### 2. Ongoing discourse

Potential pushback from the building trades unions prompts the Clinton campaign to delay a statement on KXL from August to September. The Clinton campaign wants to take the stance to ease pressure from environmental groups and in particular to earn the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters. Why did candidate Hillary Clinton stay silent on KXL in the first place?

When Hillary Clinton first begins her campaign in April, the campaign team discusses taking a stance on KXL and notes the upcoming permit decision. Brian Fallon, press secretary: "The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?" (yes, this is the same quote as above). The campaign team, and in particular John Podesta--who had previously been affiliated with the resistance against KXL (see [[Table on anti-KXL groups|Clinton email tables#anti-kxl]])--actively monitor the discourse on KXL, and in particular the rumors around an imminent rejection of the permit application. John Podesta on April 22: "Are you ready for a keystone announcement [by President Obama] tomorrow? Have no knowledge, but can’t figure out why he’s headed to the everglades [sic]." Jake Sullivan, chief foreign policy advisor, in response: "I've heard May 28 (timed to [US Senate] recess)." A negative finding of the national interest determination--which Clinton first initiated in her role as a Secretary of State in 2009--would render a Clinton campaign statement on KXL obsolete, or at least less controversial. Over time, reports or rumors regarding an upcoming permit decision keep emerging. Most notably, Senator John Hoeven on July 28 states on the Senat floor: "What I'm hearing from multiple sources is that he is going to turn down Keystone when [the Senate is] out [on recess] in August" [@Snyder2015]. Later in an interview he clarifies: "got a couple sources, and that’s what they’re saying. But I can’t tell you who" [@Snyder2015].

From the perspective of the Clinton campaign, it is unnecessary to take a position on Keystone XL, *because* the White House's decision on the permit is imminent. 
Should the Clinton campaign release a statement on KXL if the team assumes that a rejection of the permit is imminent? As implied by the very short email by press secretary Brian Fallon that has already been quoted above twice, to release a statement only after the White House has made a decision on the permit would be advantageous for the campaign. John Podesta, in a similar vein: "Now if POTUS would finally kill Keystone [sic] all could be good in the kingdom". See further [[Table on ongoign discourse|Clinton email tables#a-with-regard-to-the-kxl-permit-application]]. See [[Section Introspective|Application suspension episode#4-introspective]] for the Clinton campaign's eventual shift on the issue.

### 3. Anticipated effect

To participate in discourse is not as easy as drafting a statement and then releasing it. The Clinton campaign teams considerations indicate that the same statement, sent at different times of the week, can have very different effects. There is the obvious step of pushing the release of a statemen back to take place after the meeting with key stakeholders, the building trades unions. Nikki Budzinski: "Ideally to get [taking a stance on KXL] passed [sic] the Sept 9 meeting with the Building trades would be a personal god-send [sic]". Even then, it is not as easy as just waiting until *after* the meeting. Nikki Budzinski again: "I have reservations on the aggressive rollout timed to the meeting. I think it might be more natural to let it sit for a day knowing that it could leak and do [the announcement] the next day". Besides concerns regarding the stakeholer and potential ally, the campaign teams considers the schedule of unrelated events. "Thursday would be better press-wise so [Hillary Clinton’s KXL announcement] doesn’t compete with her Iran speech on Wednesday." "We could even have her come out against Keystone on Monday as well (not sure where that stands), which will solicit criticism but that might help distract from [Hillary Clinton email controversy]." See [[Table on anticipated effect|Clinton email tables#3-anticipated-effect]].

### 4. Introspective

Besides the timing--or rather the decision on action or inaction--the content of discursive action is also subject to debate. A determinant factor proves to be not merit or the subject matter, but questions of consistency with past statements, of identity, or of how the statements will reflect on Hillary Clinton. Joel Benenson, chief strategist: "This op-ed [on KXL] makes her seem totally political. Her reason for being against it is because 'she can’t stay silent on an issue that matters to so many\'?\? [sic] She has been silent. I don’t think this construct will fly.". The perceived shift, from 'inclined' to approve, to not interfering with a process that she initiated, to finally coming out against KXL is the biggest challenge to the campaign. Jim Margolis, Senior media advisor: "[What Brian Fallon pointed out] has been bothering me as well. We repeatedly said we couldn’t [take a stance on KXL] and then launch an op Ed [sic] without much explanation." Taking an honest stance on KLX proves to be unworkable: 

> Given that we just offered an apology on [the Hillary Clinton email controversy] that some reporters think happened 'on a dime' after months of resistance, do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity? I think we could seem consistent with our past statements about not wanting to get ahead of POTUS on Keystone if her position merely leaked out of the labor meeting. That would seem like a private comment that she didn't intend to become public — to an unfriendly audience, no less — and so it might achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. I just worry that announcing our position so fulsomely in an oped amounts to leading with our chin and will inspire loud cries of hypocrisy from reporters.
>
> --Brian Fallon

### 5. Reconciling

When--or rather after--the campaign team has made the decision to draft a stance against KXL, the work of *reconciling* this position with the stakeholders and allies begins. The emails highlight the inherently cynical nature of this undertaking. Rather than weighing the merit of different positions against each other, and creating a "blend" or compromise, it is a very superficial process of finding issues that can be traded off against each other. Sometimes, there are simple ways to appease one side of a debate. Nikki Budzinski: "Could we beef up the mentioning jobs? O'Malley made the mistake with the trades of stating that energy jobs are temporary. They really bristle at that. Could we mention that these are 'jobs and careers' for many workers and as we transition [Hillary Clinton] wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word" (for the full quote, see [[Section Quotes|Application suspension episode#appease-unions]]). Other times, the trade-offs are more complex, and more material. Eventually, the campaign team decides to draft an op-ed that uses KXL to pivot to energy infrastructure, including climate change--for strategic reasons, to appear less narrow and take weight of the KXL decision. To soften the blow from the building trades unions, the campaign team drafts measures that would create work for the members of specific unions. The team is very upfront about this: 

> 2. *Modernizing our Pipeline System – *A pledge to repair or replace thousands of miles of outdated pipeline by the end of [Hillary Clinton's] first term, through a new "Pipeline Partnership": that supports rate relief for states, cities and rural communities that accelerate replacement of outdated pipes (good for LiUNA and [United Association]).
> 
> --Trevor Houser, Energy advisor (see [[Section Quotes|Application suspension episode#pipeline-safety-unions]] for full quote)

<!--The emails make frequent references to unions
The emails feature rumors regarding the president that cause Hillary to hold of
The emails consider how statements make maximum effect
The emails philosophize on the very nature of taking a stance
The emails show *compromise* as a very cynical natured action--not as adopting a foreign position
Can the cynical nature of compromise be shaken off as discourse becomes baked into more future discourse?
Identity-->

<!--Lie idle-->

<!--Public information are limited about what TransCanada plotted and how it viewed the field ahead of their decision to ask for the permit application to be suspended. "A source involved in the project" [@Panetta2015] let the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation know that TransCanada had learned by August 2015 that a permit rejection was imminent, and that TransCanada planned to either reapply, or file a suit under the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement--both of which TransCanada subsequently did. The request to suspend the application shows that TransCanada viewed their chances as better under the future administration--which proved true, other than for the unexpected consequences of the new administrations botched permit approval. -->

### Additional dimension: Clinton email leak

Where originally, the pressure of environmentalists on Clinton made the defeat of KXL seem more likely, the leak of Clinton's emails ironically inverted this effect slightly. The brought to light the calculative approach that Clinton took with regard to the issue. Commentators saw her move in a new light: The calculative approach confirmed in the eyes of commentators the impression that Clinton was less of a woman of conviction, and more of a untrostworthy populist (needs references/triangulation). The leak had an effect of cancelling out the positiv effect she seeked to gain from the original move. Finally, the "meta dimension" of the issue seems to have paralized the Clinton campaign itself--"do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?" [@Brian2015]. Members of the campaign spend weeks deliberating on how to come into the open with their position on KXL.

## Conclusion

Back to the original motivation of the literature, on demonstrating the relationship between discourse and institutional change. Discourse, at least at a surface level, cannot fully explain institutional change. To do so, one needs to enter relatively deep, and confront a lot of processes that may seem like noise. The frames that arise can stabilize and constitute new institutional arrangements. A difference need to be drawn between micro-level processes that change relatively benign things such as an individual pipeline and more radical, wide-reaching changes that occur over, say, decades. We see in this case study many of the frames drawn up in a relatively cynical fashion to accomplish strategic goals. At what point do these frames come to be seen in a less cynical fashion, so internalized that they constitute a new institutional status quo? Is there a transition from a cynical view to taken-for-grantedness? And if so, how does this transition take place?

Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?". The team discusses avoidance tactics: "[...] if we want to have her express skepticism we can do so through a spox [spokesperson] answer to question, using our QA" [@Brian2015].
</br>|       | 22   | Clinton campaign anticipates upcoming permit decision by White House, either the next day or timed to May Congress recess [@Sullivan2015].

LIUNA in particular maintains critical stance: "we should not be surprised if LIUNA still puts out a critical statement in response to our statement when [the op-ed] goes out. [...] You might even notice them reaching out to Republicans, that is for show" [@Budzinski2015b].
</br>|       |      | Clinton campaign drafts new responses to League of Conservative Voters questionnaire from July. The new response is a solid and concise rundown of activists' anti-KXL rhetorics [@Ogden2015a].

<!--</br>| June  | 04   | Candidate Perry in his announcement speech: "On day one, I will also sign an executive order approving the construction of the Keystone Pipeline." [@Perry2015]-->
<!--</br>|       | 25   | Clinton team still discusses KXL. "'[Option] (1) Don't comment and hope it goes away' [...] 'Or option 3 - lean into this to send a wink-wink to enviros while she continues to give her non-answer'" [@Ferguson2015].-->
<!--</br>|       | 27   | Clinton presents her climate plan. When asked about KXL: "I will refrain from commenting [...]" [@Foran2015]. Environmental groups positive reception of her plan is overshadowed by their concern over KXL [@Miller2015].-->
<!--</br>|       | 28   | Sanders attacks Clinton on KXL: "It is hard for me to understand how one can be concerned about climate change but not vigorously oppose the Keystone pipeline" [@Strauss2015].-->

<!--</br>|       | 07   | The final stance is still being discussed: "'is she coming out against Keystone XL?' [...] 'We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the President in public'" [@Schwerin2015]. At the same time, the stance is impacted by the unfolding Hillary Clinton email controversy: "We could even have her come out against Keystone on Monday as well (not sure where that stands), which will solicit criticism but that might help distract from emails" [@Palmieri2015].-->

<!--</br>|       | 23   | Rumored date of presidents decision on KXL is now late October. "Maybe they decided to push it until after the Canadian election on 10/19" [@Budzinski2015]. On the potential of KXL op-ed, Clinton campaign Labour Outreach Director remarks: "Ideally to get passed [sic] the Sept 9 meeting with the [NABTU] would be a personal god-send" [@Budzinski2015]. Labour Outreach Director also suggests specific language for the op-ed to appease unions, such as "Careers is their buzz word" [@Budzinski2015].-->
<!--</br>|       | 7-9  | Clinton campaign continues Aug 23 discussion of KXL op-ed. The discussion shows a range of dimensions considered by the team as framings--consistency, developments, climate change, (political) energy and tonality, timing, language, job creation, data as an afterthought. See [[Clinton campaign--KXL dimensions]].-->

## Quotes

### Pipeline safety--unions

Aug 22, 2015

> 1. *National Infrastructure Bank* – HRC mentioned this in her launch speech but it’s called out more specifically here (positive for all the trades).
>
> 2. *Modernizing our Pipeline System – *A pledge to repair or replace thousands of miles of outdated pipeline by the end of her first term, through a new “Pipeline Partnership” that supports rate relief for states, cities and rural communities that accelerate replacement of outdated pipes (good for LiUNA and UA).
>
> 3. *Increase Rail Safety *– Accelerate the phase-out of outdated tank cars and repair track defects (will create jobs for affiliates with exposure on the tank car manufacturing and track repair fronts, though the Teamsters may be negative if they see it as slowing oil-by-rail volumes).
>
> 4. *Enhance Grid Security* - Provide new tools and resources to states, cities and rural communities to make the investments necessary to improve grid resilience to both cyber-attack and extreme weather events (positive for IBEW).
>
> 5. *Expanding Consumer Choice:* Offer financing tools for grid investments that support the integration of distributed energy resources and for gas pipeline investments that enable households and businesses to switch away from heating oil and other petroleum products (the trades won’t love the distributed energy piece but the expanded natural gas pipeline network to enable replacement of old fuel oil furnaces with natural gas furnaces is positive for LiUNA, UA and the Boilermakers) .
>
> 6. *Transmission Investment:* Ensure the federal government is a partner in getting low-cost wind and other renewable energy to market through improved federal coordination and cooperation with local governments and power companies (positive for IBEW).
>
> 7. *Transportation Funding: *Work with Congress to close corporate tax loopholes and increase invest investment in transportation solutions that expand transit access and reduce congestion, commute times, oil consumption, and pollution (positive for IBEW, ironworkers and other public transit-exposed trades).
>

### Appease unions

Aug 23, 2015

> 2. Could we include the terminology around "current baseload needs" in the current energy economy in both the fact sheet and Op Ed?  This will at least tip the hat to where we are today with the acknowledgement that we are transitioning to green.
>
> 3. When we talk about infrastructure standards, could we please mention prevailing wage and project labor agreements as one good set of standards? 
>
> 4. Could we beef up the mentioning jobs? O'Malley made the mistake with the trades of stating that energy jobs are temporary. They really bristle at that. Could we mention that these are "jobs and careers" for many workers and as we transition HRC wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word.
> 5. As I mention above, the Trades will attack Obama on raising energy prices, could HRC's OpEd and Fact sheet mention that she wants to see protections for consumers for those potential rising prices?
>
> -- @Budzinski2015
