## Notes
* Does change *cascade down*? How do the top management team's decisions matter for the bulk of workers?
* Connection to *risk and resilience*. Two different perspectives: frequent changes are eroding the ability of companies to prevent or handle negative events (resilience). Or - managers are willing to take a risk, knowingly accept the possibility that negative events occur, or that negative events cannot be handles well by the organization.
* Connection to *income inequality*: higher pace, and modus operandi for achieving growth under new management is often layoffs.
