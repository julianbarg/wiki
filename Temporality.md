### One-paragraph summary
Temporality is a very rich and diverse field. The origins of the field (in the strategy literature) are in characteristics of temporality, for instance speed, and event-time vs. clock-time. Event-time describes the perception of time based on events. It was first introduced by [[Gersick (1994)|Gersick 1994]] based on the observation that some decision makers wait for key events, or make decisions to attain key events. Clock-time was also described by [[Gersick (1994)|Gersick 1994]] (as temporal pacing), and describes the flow of time as measured in time units such as year, month, etc. Around the same time, [[Eisenhardt (1989)|Eisenhardt 1989]] laid the foundation for a literature on speed. She ran some of the first studies on the speed of decision making in organizations, and her data suggests that microcomputer firms which engage in fast decision making, e.g., through the use of real-time information, manage to include more, not less, information in their decision making process.

More recently, a literature on temporality has emerged as a key factor to research on business sustainability. Sustainability is intertwined with questions of short-term and long-term perspectives ([[Bansal et al 2019]]: 146), as evident in the definition of sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" ([[WCED 1987]]: IV). [[Bansal and DesJardine (2014)|Bansal and DesJardine 2014]] point out that only the focus on temporality (as compared to a focus on responsiblity or CSR) can ensure sustainability. For example, a company can be responsible (e.g., toward its community) by providing essential goods or services but to do so it could be using up resources that future generations need to meet their needs.

## Notes

### Teaching idea
Why not distribute a case that uses NPV and provides different discount rates in different cases, and then let students discuss it, and discover their discount rates are different. One could probably also run an experiment based on this idea: can we nudge students toward choosing a certain discount rate? Could we determine the attitude of students toward a project, and subsequently observe how they adjust the discount rate?
