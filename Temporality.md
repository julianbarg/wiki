### One-paragraph summary
Temporality is a very rich and diverse field. The origins of the field (in the strategy literature) are in characteristics of temporality, for instance speed, and event-time vs. clock-time. Event-time describes the perception of time based on events. It was first introduced by [[Gersick (1994)|Gersick 1994]] based on the observation that some decision makers wait for key events, or make decisions to attain key events. Clock-time was also described by [[Gersick (1994)|Gersick 1994]] (as temporal pacing), and describes the flow of time as measured in time units such as year, month, etc. Around the same time, [[Eisenhardt (1989)|Eisenhardt 1989]] laid the foundation for a literature on speed. She ran some of the first studies on the speed of decision making in organizations, and her data suggests that microcomputer firms which engage in fast decision making, e.g., through the use of real-time information, manage to include more, not less, information in their decision making process.

More recently, a literature on temporality has emerged as a key factor to research on business sustainability. Sustainability is intertwined with questions of short-term and long-term perspectives ([[Bansal et al 2019]]: 146), as evident in the prominent definition of sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" ([[WCED 1987]]: IV). [[Bansal and DesJardine (2014)|Bansal and DesJardine 2014]] point out that only the focus on temporality (as compared to a focus on responsibility or CSR) can ensure sustainability. For example, a company could be behaving responsible (e.g., toward its community) by providing essential goods or services for to a vulnerable society, but to do so it could be using up resources that future generations need to meet their needs. 

In its clearest form, the relationship between temporality and *business sustainability* is exemplified by the routinized discounting of future cash flows in NPV analyses and the focus on quarterly earnings. Decision makers fail to make the best decisions if their time horizon is the next quarterly earnings report. Similarly, managers may fail to take on very attractive projects that might yield their companies a competitive edge, because an inappropriate discount rate cab make the project appear less attractive than a competing one with more immediate payoffs ([[Bansal and DesJardine 2014]]). [[Flammer and Bansal (2017)|Flammer and Bansal 2017]] offers an empirical analysis of this issue. The authors hypothesize that investors (implicitly) apply a lower discount rate to future cash flows than CEOs do. To test this hypothesis, they carry out a regression discontinuity design (RDD) study. The independent variable are proposals on executive long-term compensation that are passed or fail by a thin margin. The study shows that investors value the (relatively) long-term time frame that stems from the long-term compensation proposals - the stocks of the companies which adopt the proposals show an increase in abnormal returns. To describe this phenomenon, Flammer and Bansal (2017) offer a discussion of the discount rates that executives and investors (implicitly) apply to the future - executives in contracts without long-term incentives value the short-term more than the long-term, they apply a higher discount rate to future cash than investors do. The CEOs react to the adoption of long-term incentives by increasing R&D spending as well as stakeholder management, and the long-term operating performance of the firms also increases.
