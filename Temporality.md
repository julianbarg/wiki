### One-paragraph summary
Temporality is a very rich and diverse field. The origins of the field (in the strategy literature) are in characteristics of temporality, for instance speed or event-time vs. clock-time. 

More recently, temporality and sustainability has been on the rise.

## Notes

### Teaching idea
Why not distribute a case that uses NPV and provides different discount rates in different cases, and then let students discuss it, and discover their discount rates are different. One could probably also run an experiment based on this idea: can we nudge students toward choosing a certain discount rate? Could we determine the attitude of students toward a project, and subsequently observe how they adjust the discount rate?
