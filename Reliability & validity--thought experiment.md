## Thought experiment I: "simulation" style

*  Uppercase letters denominate people
*  Greek letters denominate ideas
*  The lowercase letters x, y, and z denominate everything that is independently perceived by multiple observers, such as products, services, events, etc.

Examples: 

*  _A_ learns about $\alpha$. $\beta$ is a flaw in _A_'s previous design for a product, $\alpha$. _A_ never informs anybody about $\beta$, and beta does not become reliable knowledge.
*  _A_ does not like _B_. _A_ sabotages event _x_ that is organized by _B_. After the event, _A_ blames the problems cause by _A_'s sabotage on _B_. Let $\alpha$ be the knowledge of _A_'s lack of ability to organize events that are similar to _x_. $\alpha$ is _not_ valid knowledge--we cannot use $\alpha$ to predic _A_'s ability to organize event _y_. $\alpha$ becomes reliable knowledge.
    * To the connection between reliability and validity: _A_ might well internalize the problems with event _x_ and subsequently be unable to organize event _y_ because of a lack of confidence. _We cannot say for sure though_--this is not valid knowledge.
