## Summary

The science on oil spills--at least in marine environment--seemed to be settles, due to the (relatively) good biodegradability of hydrocarbons ([[Fitzpatrick et al 2015]]). However, recent research has found that long-term impacts are more sever than expected, due to complex interactions ([[Barron et al 2020]], [[Beyer et al 2016]]). Even less is known about the long-term impacts on riverine environment, due to a dearth of data. Spilled oil can sink to the river bed, leading to oiled sediment. Affected are in particular benthic organisms and fish eggs. Unfortunately, the physical disturbance from removing this oiled sediment also constitutes severe damages to the environment ([[Fitzpatrick et al 2015]]).
