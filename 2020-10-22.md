## [[March, Sproull & Tamuz 1991]]

Not all history matters equally. Where less data exists, organizations can extrapolate from this little data. The argument is similar to event time vs. clock time [[Kunisch et al. 2017]]. The authors also point out that learning does not only occur from actual experiences. Near-failures can be used to learn, and modelling. The authors then introduce reliability and validity. They argue that learning is generally conservative, and demonstrate how organizations can sustain their beliefs in light of missing or even contrary evidence. Then, they dwelve into the trade-off between validity and reliability. To obtain new, valid knowledge, organizations need to explore, but to explore is detrimental to a shared understanding. To ensure a shared (reliable) understanding, organizations need to keep a tight hold on individuals understanding, but to do so prevents exploration, and the aqcuisition of new, valid knowledge. Rare events can help with that, as they allow individuals to "weight" experiences.

In summary, the authors describe experience as not a "big data" kind of process, but one where few (or even no) events are aggregated. They then provide their own critical perspective of how this process can go wrong.

### 1. What are the authors trying to do?

Describe how organizations learn from rare events? Do they have an agenda that is wider than that? In classic March-fashion, they don't tell us. Also, moving to reliability and validity is arguably swerving a bit from rare events.

### 2. Are they right?

They are right with the observation that not all events are equally important or attended to equally. Organizations have some experiences that are objectively more important than others, critical moments, or moments that are fashioned into them. The authors are also right that this can be problematic, when an invalid understanding is raised onto a pedestal.

### 3. If you do not believe they are right, what would you do about it?

Write on reliability and validity? How the pipeline industry can develop an invalid understanding, in support of their industry.

### 4. How does the article help us think about navigating a rare event/crisis?

On the one hand, the authors show that we do not need actual experiences to prepare for rare events. On the other hand, the authors warn us of how easily we can succumb to an invalid understanding, from just a few, or even based on no exisiting datapoints.

## [[Rerup & Zbaracki 2020]]

### 1. What are the authors trying to do?

Understand March et al 1991? Talk about reliability and validity? Bring politics back into the picture? They say they want to bring reliability and validity back to the center stage of discussion, which is in line with talking about politics. Putting politics front and center on learning.

### 2. Are they right?

Everybody's first instinct might be to ask "but is this really learning?" "Isn't it just politics?" But looking at individual actors, it becomes clear that they genuinly attempt learning. Even for the GGE it seems thinkable that they are trying to explore their genuinly held prejudices against Estonia, and are not solely engaging in bad faith politics.

### 3. If you do not believe they are right, what would you do about it?

Agree with the mechanisms, not with (Klaus') conclusion. Discussion just before conclusion then puts together an overall motivatoin, to explain how effective learning can be accomplished? Is that the story though? I thought this was a story of taking stock of population level learning. In theory, there could be effective learning, but isn't it much more likely to devolve into counterproductive politics? I thought the gist of the story was "populations learn what's reliable". Would I write something like that, or would I rather give readers what we somehow assume they want, some feel-good summary?

### 4. How does the article help us think about navigating a rare event/crisis?

It gives us a neat cynical starting point?

### Note

Why not a summary along the lines of "at they end they were all wrong, the hull was somehow torn all along."

"But they were all of them deceived, for another rig was made. Deep in the sea of the Baltic, in the currents of the Gulf of Finland, the dark Soviet land forces forged a masterful rig, and this rig pounded into the Estonia with cruelty, with malice that caused the cessation of all life on board."
