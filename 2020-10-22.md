[[March, Sproull & Tamuz 1991]]

Not all history matters equally. Where less data exists, organizations can extrapolate from this little data. The argument is similar to event time vs. clock time [[Kunisch et al. 2017]]. The authors also point out that learning does not only occur from actual experiences. Near-failures can be used to learn, and modelling. The authors then introduce reliability and validity. They argue that learning is generally conservative, and demonstrate how organizations can sustain their beliefs in light of missing or even contrary evidence. Then, they dwelve into the trade-off between validity and reliability. To obtain new, valid knowledge, organizations need to explore, but to explore is detrimental to a shared understanding. To ensure a shared (reliable) understanding, organizations need to keep a tight hold on individuals understanding, but to do so prevents exploration, and the aqcuisition of new, valid knowledge. Rare events can help with that, as they allow individuals to "weight" experiences.

In summary, the authors describe experience as not a "big data" kind of process, but one where few (or even no) events are aggregated. They then provide their own critical perspective of how this process can go wrong.

## 1. What are the authors trying to do?

Describe how organizations learn from rare events? Do they have an agenda that is wider than that? In classic March-fashion, they don't tell us. Also, moving to reliability and validity is arguably swerving a bit from rare events.

## 2. Are they right?

They are right with the observation that not all events are equally important or attended to equally. Organizations have some experiences that are objectively more important than others, critical moments, or moments that are fashioned into them. The authors are also right that this can be problematic, when an invalid understanding is raised onto a pedestal.
