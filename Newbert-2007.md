## One-page summary
Newbert (2007) explains that the RBV may not be accepted as ‘true’ theory because it has not been empirically validated yet. This paper points out that Barney and Arikan (2001) have failed to find support for the RBV though they review 166 empirical papers with RBV logic for two reasons. First, they do not count non-findings as the counterevidence of the theory, only regarding the opposite significant findings as that of the theory (It surely is not a conservative way of testing). Secondly, their 166 empirical papers seem to have a sampling bias since the authors tend to omit papers from other academic disciplines than business.  

To deal with the above-mentioned flaws of Barney and Arikan (2001), The paper retests the empirical validity of the RBV by adopting the methodology employed by David and Han (2004). The paper uses an advanced sampling approach to select empirical papers (e.g. includes only articles in scholarly journals, excludes simple regression analysis without control variables). In the results, the authors first report that only 53% of individual tests are supported. To better understand independent variables, those variables are subcategorized into four groups such as resource heterogeneity (71% of capability-related tests are supported, whereas 37% of a resource-related tests are supported), organizing (58% are supported), conceptual-level (77% are supported), and dynamic capabilities approaches (even though 38% are supported, not many empirical tests exist since the theoretical concept was premature at that time). For Dependent Variables, the authors show that most tests use performance rather than competitive advantage as their D.Vs, thus they do not properly translate the theoretical concepts into an empirical model.   

This paper contributes to the strategic management literature by informing scholars on the status quo of RBV as a theory to be validated. By reviewing empirical papers, the authors successfully provide the direction in which scholars need to move forward to develop the RBV as a robust theory.  

While the authors did a terrific job on reviewing existing empirical papers, I may suggest several points that the paper has failed to consider. First, information about empirical context should be included. Since the RBV takes a role of supplementing the market power perspective, it is interesting to show the existence of “resource” in a specific industry. Moreover, Because a dynamic capability represent the focal firm’s adaptive capability towards the dynamic environment, information about industries need to be analyzed (e.g. for an automobile industry, dynamic capability matters) to provide with a boundary condition. Second, both a sustained competitive advantage and a competitive advantage need to be clarified in this paper. Following Barney (1991)’s logic, inimitability leads the focal firm to have a sustained competitive advantage. However, there are several papers which do not follow Barney (1991)’s logic, but the authors do not point out this theoretical flaw in the papers (refer to p129, table3). Even though an empirical validation is the most important task for the RBV scholars to deal with, it is also important for them to use the theoretical concepts and logics in a proper way.
