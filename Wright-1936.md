## One-paragraph summary
Wright (1936) originally set out to discuss the possibility of a $700 plane, as envisioned by the government at the time (to be realized through an order of large quantity - 10.000 units). His paper is frequently quoted as the starting point of discussions of the learning curve, and it is the source of the assumption of a learning rate of 0.8. Sometimes, it is difficult to divide his discussion into learning curve and economies of scale. Wright touches on many points that are relevant to date. The learning of individual workers ("economy of motions"), and the reduction of waste. The possibility of greater standardization of work steps as more units are produced, and the lower cost of tools as producers figure out what works and what does not (these two factors also allow for the use of "less skilled labor"). And finally, the fact that "when production orders are received, it is frequently necessary to re-design large numbers of parts" (ibid. 124). He even considers the overhead cost (economies of scale and diseconomies of scale). And finally, he realized that a break in production
