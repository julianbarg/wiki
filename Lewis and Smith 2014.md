## One-paragraph summary
Review of paradox as a metatheory. Paradox informs a lot of research, and allows for analyzing phenomena, but it also provides a new perspective on theorizing. Businesses often face dualisms, such as short-term versus long-term, exploration versus exploitation, etc. Contingency theory famously seeks for criteria that favor one approach over the other. However, when the tension to be addressed is enduring, paradox calls for a holistic and dynamic rethinking, to clear the way for synergistic solutions. The paradox take on exploration-exploitation tension for instance is that this tension will not be resolved, rather, a dynamic management style should be found that incorporates both these contradictory approaches. A contingency approach to the exploration-exploitation tension is likely to be a temporary "solution", but paradox scholars will know that a bigger perspective on temporality will reveal that conditions are due to change, and the contingency approach yields a solution for the moment, not one that will hold forever.
