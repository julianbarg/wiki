## One-paragraph summary

Case study on the public perception of one specific ecosytem--a local river. The public perception that the quality of the river is good aligns with actual monitoring data, the public seems to confound aesthetics and perceived naturalness. The survey also finds that time spend near the river is correlated with perceiption of water quality issues. Unfortunately, the generally high-quality river did undergo a restoration process after the survey was carried out which may have decreased the water quality.
