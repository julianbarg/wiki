# Greenwashing literature: methodology for O&E propol submission

[[_TOC_]]

The declared intention of this literature review is to illuminate a *broad* phenomenon. In particular, we aim to include recent trends such as *woke washing* [@Sobande2019] and *symbolic civil rights* [@Edelman2016; @Buchter2021] in the final corpus. To accomplish the goal of shedding light on a diverse literature, we follow mostly the model of @Oliveira2019 for a broad literature search: we make a dedicated effort at the start of our search to identify additional keywords *before* the we create the final corpus within relevant disciplines [see also @Marescaux2021]. For an overview of our nine-step literature search, see Figure 1.
