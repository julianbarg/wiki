# Greenwashing literature: methodology for O&E propol submission

[[_TOC_]]

The declared intention of this literature review is to illuminate a *broad* phenomenon. Specifically, we aim to include recent trends such as *woke washing* [@Sobande2019] and *symbolic civil rights* [@Edelman2016; @Buchter2021] in the final corpus. To accomplish the goal of shedding light on a diverse literature, we follow mostly the model of @Oliveira2019 for a broad literature search: we make a dedicated effort at the start of our search to identify additional keywords *before* the we create the final corpus within relevant disciplines [see also @Marescaux2021]. For an overview of our nine-step literature search, see [[Figure 1|Greenwashing Literature Review#figures]].

/(1) We study existing reviews on greenwashing. In particular, this review builds on @Lyon2015 and hence covers the years 2015 to 2021. We also include the year 2014 in our literature search to cover any articles that had not been indexed at the time of Lyon and Montgomery's literature search. (2) To caputure the breadth of the greenwashing phenomenon, we first conduct an exploratory search. We conduct a full-text search within the EBSCO Business Source Complete database and extract paragraphs that contain the word greenwashing or greenwash. This exploratory search yielded 1,265 articles. (3) From the extracted paragraphs, we compile a list of greenwashing-ajacent phenomena--these are our initial keywords.

After creating an initial search list, we begin the creation of our corpus. (4) Our journals of interest include all FT 50 journal, and a list of journals at the intersection of sustainability and organization theory such as Organization & Environment. For the final journal list see Table 1. (5) We search for our initial list of keywords in only our journals of interests. This search is limited to titles, keywords, and abstracts. (6) To ensure coverage of articles that are yet to be indexed, we manually review the latest issues of our journals of interest. (7) We begin an iterative selection of our final corpus. The initial corpus consists of the articles obtained in step five and six. (8) The articles are manually coded for relevance. An articles is included in the final corpus when all coders agree that it is relevant. The coders resolv instances of divergent coding in discussion. This manual review may also yield new keywords that result in more articles being added to the initial corpus.

\(9) We conduct a quantitative analysis of the resulting corpus. This qualitative analysis includes a citation analysis and the creation of a topic model. We carry out the citation analysis using both VOSviewer [@Marasaux2021] and citation gecko. The citation analysis identifies articles that are cited by many works in our resulting corpus--these are articles that have informed the research on greenwashing but do not use this terminology. These identified articles are candidates for inclusion of our review, hence we add them to initial corpus from step seven. We also conduct an analysis of works that three or more of the articles in our corpus. This analysis of citing works ensures convergence: if our literature search so far has been exhaustive, no additional relevant articles in journals of interest should be found now. Next, we create a topic model based on the articles in the final corpus. The topic model allows us to identify latent patterns in our corpus [@Hannigan2019; Sarta2021]. For instance, articles may cover related phenomena but do not use the keywords. In other words, the topic model may allow us to identify connections between articles that have not been made by the authors themselves. These latent categories will then inform the structure of the final literature review.

> *Annotation*: Abstract search--not broad enough to identify trends like "woke washing". ABI/INFORM also possible. Business Source Complete has better coverage--more hits (~1,000 vs ~1,200). Could do a combination? Would proabably be mostly duplicates except for some obscure journals. Ultimate would have the best coverage. EBSCO has the advantage of being able to export list of matches.
