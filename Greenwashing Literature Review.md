# Greenwashing literature: methodology for O&E propol submission

[[_TOC_]]

The declared intention of this literature review is to illuminate a *broad* phenomenon. Specifically, we aim to include recent trends such as *woke washing* [@Sobande2019] and *symbolic civil rights* [@Edelman2016; @Buchter2021] in the final corpus. To accomplish the goal of shedding light on a diverse literature, we follow mostly the model of @Oliveira2019 for a broad literature search: we make a dedicated effort at the start of our search to identify additional keywords *before* the we create the final corpus within relevant disciplines [see also @Marescaux2021]. For an overview of our nine-step literature search, see [[Figure 1|Greenwashing Literature Review#flowchart]].

(1) We study existing reviews on greenwashing. In particular, this review will build on @Lyon2015 and focus on the the period of 2015 to 2021. We also include the year 2014 in our literature search to cover any articles that had not been indexed at the time of Lyon and Montgomery's literature search.

> *Annotation*: Abstract search--not broad enough to identify trends like "woke washing". ABI/INFORM also possible. Business Source Complete has better coverage--more hits (~1,000 vs ~1,200). Could do a combination? Would proabably be mostly duplicates except for some obscure journals. Ultimate would have the best coverage. EBSCO has the advantage of being able to export list of matches.
