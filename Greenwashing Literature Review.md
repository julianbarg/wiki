# Greenwashing literature: methodology for O&E propol submission

[[_TOC_]]

The declared intention of this literature review is to illuminate a *broad* phenomenon. Specifically, we aim to include in the final corpus recent trends ranging from *woke washing* [@Sobande2019] and *symbolic civil rights* [@Edelman2016; @Buchter2021] to such extremes as *eco-criminality* [@Torelli2020]. To shed light on a diverse literature, we follow the model of @Oliveira2019 for a broad literature search: we will make a dedicated effort at the start of our search to identify additional keywords *before* the we create the final corpus within relevant disciplines [see also @Marescaux2021]. For a step-by-step of our methodology, see [[Table 1|Greenwashing Literature Review#tables]].

\(1) We study existing reviews on greenwashing. In particular, this review builds on @Lyon2015 and hence covers the years 2014 to 2021. We have already reviewed a number of recent reviews and highly cited articles [e.g., @Torelli2020; @Szabo2020; @Gatti2019; @Carlos2018; @Marquis2016] (2) To caputure the breadth of the greenwashing phenomenon, we first conduct an exploratory search. We have already conduct a full-text search within the EBSCO Business Source Complete database and extract paragraphs that contain the word greenwashing or greenwash. This exploratory search yielded 1,265 articles. (3) From the articles gathered in step two, we compile our list of initial keywords.

> *Annotation*: I used "woke washing" as a litmus test to see if we can land on that by only searching abstracts instead of conducting a full-text search. Unfortunately, we could not. Conducting a full-text search yields a much bigger initial corpus: ~1,200 articles instead of 300. But I think it is justified that step if we want to conduct a literature analysis that includes new trends such as "woke washing". We can conduct a full-text search using either EBSCO or ABI/INFORM as you did in your original review. We could also combine both. However, EBSCO yields slightly more results, and on a cursory glimpse it seemed that all results from ABI/INFORM are also included in the EBSCO search. EBSCO seems to be the preferred choice in JOM--none of the recent reviews I checked use ABI/INFORM. EBSCO also has the advantage of being able to export a list of results, which I can then feed into a script to download a large share of the articles. UWO has access to EBSCO Business Source Complete. There is a higher tier, Business Source Ultimate, which offers access to a couple hundred more journals, but I don't know how relevant those are to us.

> *Annotation 2*: The initial step of extracting relevant keywords would be relatively easy to delegate. All that needs to be done here is to open the pdf, search for "greenwash" and look in the containing paragraphs for similar keywords.

After creating an initial search list, we begin the creation of our corpus. (4) Our journals of interest include all FT 50 journal, and a list of journals at the intersection of sustainability and organization theory such as Organization & Environment [cf. @Rietveld2021]. For the final journal list see [[Table 3|Greenwashing Literature Review#tables]]. (5) We search for our initial list of keywords in only our journals of interests. This search is limited to titles, keywords, and abstracts. (6) To ensure coverage of articles that are yet to be indexed, we manually review the latest issues of our journals of interest. (7) We begin an iterative selection of our final corpus. The initial corpus consists of the articles obtained in step five and six. (8) The articles are manually coded for relevance. An articles is included in the final corpus when all coders agree that it is relevant. The coders resolv instances of divergent coding in discussion. This manual review may also yield new keywords that result in more articles being added to the initial corpus.

## Quantitative analysis

\(9) We conduct a quantitative analysis of the resulting corpus. This qualitative analysis includes a citation analysis and the creation of a topic model. We carry out the citation analysis using both VOSviewer [@Marescaux2021] and citation gecko. The citation analysis identifies articles that are cited by many works in our resulting corpus--these are articles that have informed the research on greenwashing but do not use this terminology. These identified articles are candidates for inclusion of our review, hence we add them to initial corpus from step seven. We also conduct an analysis of works that three or more of the articles in our corpus. This analysis of citing works ensures convergence: if our literature search so far has been exhaustive, no additional relevant articles in journals of interest should be found now. Next, we create a topic model based on the articles in the final corpus. The topic model allows us to identify latent patterns in our corpus [@Hannigan2019; @Sarta2021]. For instance, articles may cover related phenomena but not include the same keywords. In other words, the topic model allows us to identify connections between articles that have not been made by the authors themselves. These latent categories then inform the structure of the final literature review.

--:         | --------                                      | ---------------------
**Phase 1:**| **Demarcation of greenwashing**               | The first phase of our search capture the breadth of the greenwashing literature
<br/>       | *Step 1: Literature reviews etc.*             | We iteratively identify (a) reviews and articles that otherwise (b) synthesize or (c) expand the existing greenwashing space.<br/>---<br/>Preliminary article count: 11 (see Table 11)
<br/>       | *Step 2: Exploratory search*                  | We conduct a full-text search for "greenwash" and "greenwashing" using EBSCO Business Source Complete, and extract paragraphs with the keywords. Limited to 2014 and after.<br/>---<br/>Preliminary article count: 1,265
<br/>       | *Step 3: Initial keyword list*                | Within the extracted paragraphs, we search for all terms that are described as forms of greenashing. These terms constitute our list of initial keywords.
**Phase 2:**| **Selection of corpus**                       |
<br/>       | *Step 4: Journal selection*                   | We create a list of relevant journals to limit the breadth of our final search. The list includes FT 50 journals, and other journals that publish at the intersection of organizations and the environment such as Organization & Environment (see Table 3).
<br/>       | *Step 5: Initial corpus*                      | We obtain our initial corpus by searching for our initial keywords within the titles, abstracts, and keywords of articles that were published in 2014 and after in our selected journals.
<br/>       | *Step 6: Manual search*                       | We manually skim recent issues of our journals of interest for relevant articles that may not have been indexed yet.
<br/>       | *Step 7: Iterative corpus selection*\*        | We begin the iterative selection of our final corpus, starting with the initial corpus from steps six and seven. Where steps eight and nine surface additional relevant keywords or articles, they are added to the initial corpus.
<br/>       | *Step 8: Manual review*                       | All authors manually code the articles for relevant. Where there is agreement, the article enters the final corpus or is dropped. Instances of divergent coding are resolved in discussion. The authors also identify additional keywords for the search in step seven in this step.
**Phase 3:**| **Quantitative analysis**
<br/>       | *Step 9: Citation analysis*                   | We conduct a citation analysis of the corpus, using VOSviewer [@Marescaux2021] and Citation Gecko. The citation analysis identifies articles we may add to the initial corpus from step seven. Relevant extant articles either are (a) cited by many of the works in our corpus--these inform the greenwashing literature. Or (b) cite many of the articles in our corpus--these are potential oversights. With this analysis we verify or achieve the saturation of our search.
</br>       | *Step 10: Topic modeling*                     | Topic models identify latent patterns in a corpus [@Hannigan2019; @Sarta2021]. A broad model allows us to group articles by area, whereas a model with many topics can be used to group articles by the specific phenomenon covered. We create one or more topic models to inform our subsequent review of the literature.
**Phase 4:**| **Literature review**
