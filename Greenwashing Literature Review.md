# Greenwashing literature: methodology for O&E propol submission

[[_TOC_]]

The declared intention of this literature review is to identify a *broad* literature on greenwashing. The final corpus should including adjacent phenomena such as *woke washing* [@Sobade2019] or *symbolic civil rights* [@Edelman2016; @Buchter2021]. To accomplish this goal, we follow mostly the model of @Oliveira2019 for a broad literature search [see also @Marescaux2021].

Will follow mostly the model of @Oliveira2019
