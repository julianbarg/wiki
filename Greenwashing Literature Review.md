# Greenwashing literature: methodology for O&E propol submission

[[_TOC_]]

The declared intention of this literature review is to illuminate a *broad* phenomenon. Developments such a*woke washing* [@Sobande2019] and *symbolic civil rights* [@Edelman2016; @Buchter2021] are recent trends that we want to include in the final corpus. To accomplish the goal of shedding light on a diverse literature, we follow mostly the model of @Oliveira2019 for a broad literature search [see also @Marescaux2021]: we make a dedicated effort at the start to identify additional keywords *before* the we create the final corpus within our target disciplines.
