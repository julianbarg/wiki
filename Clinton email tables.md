2015-05-08  | (News Clips)  |               | "Other areas where Sanders is in a position to draw stark contrasts with Clinton include [...] her stance on the Keystone XL pipeline. As secretary of state, Clinton said she was 'inclined' to approve the pipeline. Since then, much like on the trade measure, Clinton has been silent on Keystone."
2015-05-11  | (News Clips)  |               | "Sanders is hesitant to criticize Clinton, saying that he respects and admires her. But pressed on the question of why he would make a better Democratic nominee, he points to three things [including] the work he has done opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. 'I'm not quite sure Hillary Clinton has come out with a position on that' he said."

Should the State Department issue the Presidential permit for this project? (Or if the State Dept decision has been announced by the time of the luncheon, what are your views on the decision?)."

2015-05-15  | (News Clips)  |               | "Among them, Schweizer says in the original version of the book that TD Bank, a major shareholder in the Keystone XL pipeline, paid Bill Clinton for speeches and then said it would 'begin selling its $1.6 billion worth of shares in the massive but potentially still-born [sic] Keystone XL crude pipeline project' after Hillary Clinton left office. But as his source on the sale of TD Bankâ€™s shares, Schweizer used a press release that was revealed to be fake in 2013."
