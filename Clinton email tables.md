2015-04-19  | Brian Fallon          | @Brian2015a   | "The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?"
2015-05-15  | Bill McKibben*        | @Adler2015    | Bill McKibben, who founded 350.org and has led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, says he is confident Sanders understands the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Sanders has opposed Keystone, while Clinton has avoided taking a position on it. "He’s been the most consistent and proactive voice in the entire Keystone fight," writes McKibben in an email.
2015-05-17  | Bill McKibben         | @Parker2015   | Mr. McKibben’s environmental organization, 350.org, has been trying to raise awareness about the ties it sees between lobbyists for the oil pipeline and former aides to Mrs. Clinton.
2015-07-11  | Tiernan Sittenfeld    |               | "[I]t’s hard to imagine we [the League of Conservation Voters] can move forward [with an endorsement] until she makes clear she now opposes KXL."
2015-07-12  | POLITICO              | @Schor2015    |  Many of [the anti-KXL] activists are without a standard-bearer in the Democratic field, and are still suspicious of Clinton because of her refusal to rule out the Keystone project. And they’ve demonstrated the capacity to put supporters in the streets, including more than 1,100 anti-Keystone protesters who went to jail after White House sit-ins four years ago. That’s offering an opening to the progressive Sanders, who has emerged as Clinton’s top rival in the polls, and O’Malley, whose once-promising campaign has yet to gain traction. [...] Sanders even launched his candidacy at an event with fellow Vermonter Bill McKibben, the activist who rose to prominence by leading the anti-Keystone crusade as part of the campaign to fight climate change.
2015-07-27  | The New Republic      | @Leber2015    | Climate Hawks Vote said in a statement that "Clinton’s climate plan is remarkable for what it does’t say, yet: no effort to keep fossil fuels in the ground, no price on carbon; no word on Keystone XL, Arctic oil, or other carbon bombs; no word on fracking; no call for adaptation."

\* Take note of this guy, he manages to get his name into the news all the time. The rumor is that if you say "Keystone XL" three times under a full moon, he will appear in front of you.

### Pro-KXL

2015-08-05  | New York Times        | @Rappeport2015| Ahead of Mr. O'Malley's appearance before the labor group on Thursday, a union leader has accused him, BloombergPolitics writes, "of 'pandering to extremist and elitist elements within the environmental movement' with his opposition to Keystone XL pipeline."
2015-08-09  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | "I am monitoring the Keystone announcement and am in connection with policy on the issue related to the building trades."
2015-08-27  | Gordon Giffin         |               | "[A]s you probably know there is a federal election campaign ongoing in Canada. The election is October 19. It would be prudent, I believe wearing my former ambassador hat, to avoid being seen to take a position on a high profile issue [Keystone XL] that could be argued to be intervention in that election."
2015-08-23  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | "I think with the trades one of the most important things is to provide [the building trades unions] a heads up, even if we’re going to be in different places [on KXL]. Not surprising I know, but the [building] trades are going to go nuclear (so to speak) on the Administration once this announcement [on the KXL permit decision] comes out."

2015-08-23  | Pete Ogden            |               | "Maybe [the White House] decided to push [the KXL permit decision] until after the Canadian election on 10/19."

### b. With regard to KXL and the Clinton campaign

2015-07-11  | WSJ                   | @Meckler2015  | Hillary Clinton’s State Department Staff Kept Tight Rein on Records [...]. In one instance, her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, told State Department records specialists she wanted to see all documents requested on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and later demanded that some be held back.
2015-07-18  | Huffington Post       |@Blumenthal2015| Hillary Clinton’s Biggest Campaign Bundlers Are Fossil Fuel Lobbyists [...]. Bundler Gordon Giffin is a former lobbyist for TransCanada, the company working to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. Giffin sits on the board of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, an investor in the pipeline. The Canadian bank paid Clinton $990,000 for speeches in the months leading up to her presidential announcement. Another Canadian financial institution with an interest in Keystone XL, TD Bank, paid her $651,000 for speaking engagements.

2015-08-23  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | Ideally to get [taking a stance on KXL] passed [sic] the Sept 9 meeting with the Building trades would be a personal god-send [sic].

Could we include the terminology around “current baseload needs” in the current energy economy in both the fact sheet and Op Ed? This will at least tip the hat to where we are today with the acknowledgement that we are transitioning to green.-->
2015-08-23  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | 4. Could we beef up the mentioning jobs? O'Malley made the mistake with the trades of stating that energy jobs are temporary. They really bristle at that. Could we mention that these are "jobs and careers" for many workers and as we transition [Hillary Rodham Clinton] wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word. 5. As I mention above, the Trades will attack Obama on raising energy prices, could [Hillary Rodham Clinton]’s OpEd and Fact sheet mention that she wants to see protections for consumers for those potential rising prices? The Op Ed will be read as very celebratory, and maybe that’s it. But I think if we could incorporate a little of these suggestions above and tone, it could be helpful.

2015-05-08  | (News Clips)  |               | "Other areas where Sanders is in a position to draw stark contrasts with Clinton include [...] her stance on the Keystone XL pipeline. As secretary of state, Clinton said she was 'inclined' to approve the pipeline. Since then, much like on the trade measure, Clinton has been silent on Keystone."
2015-05-11  | (News Clips)  |               | "Sanders is hesitant to criticize Clinton, saying that he respects and admires her. But pressed on the question of why he would make a better Democratic nominee, he points to three things [including] the work he has done opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. 'I'm not quite sure Hillary Clinton has come out with a position on that' he said."
2015-05-15  | (News Clips)  |               | On comparing Sanders and Clinton: "Bill McKibben, who founded 350.org and has led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, says he is confident Sanders understands the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground.

But as his source on the sale of TD Bank’s shares, Schweizer used a press release that was revealed to be fake in 2013."-->
