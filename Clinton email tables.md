2015-04-19  | Brian Fallon          | @Brian2015a   | "The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?"
2015-05-15  | Bill McKibben*        | @Adler2015    | Bill McKibben, who founded 350.org and has led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, says he is confident Sanders understands the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Sanders has opposed Keystone, while Clinton has avoided taking a position on it. "He’s been the most consistent and proactive voice in the entire Keystone fight," writes McKibben in an email.
2015-05-17  | Bill McKibben         | @Parker2015   | Mr. McKibben’s environmental organization, 350.org, has been trying to raise awareness about the ties it sees between lobbyists for the oil pipeline and former aides to Mrs. Clinton.
2015-07-11  | Tiernan Sittenfeld    |               | "[I]t’s hard to imagine we [the League of Conservation Voters] can move forward [with an endorsement] until she makes clear she now opposes KXL."
2015-07-12  | POLITICO              | @Schor2015    |  Many of [the anti-KXL] activists are without a standard-bearer in the Democratic field, and are still suspicious of Clinton because of her refusal to rule out the Keystone project. And they’ve demonstrated the capacity to put supporters in the streets, including more than 1,100 anti-Keystone protesters who went to jail after White House sit-ins four years ago. That’s offering an opening to the progressive Sanders, who has emerged as Clinton’s top rival in the polls, and O’Malley, whose once-promising campaign has yet to gain traction. [...] Sanders even launched his candidacy at an event with fellow Vermonter Bill McKibben, the activist who rose to prominence by leading the anti-Keystone crusade as part of the campaign to fight climate change.

\* Take note of this guy, he manages to get his name into the news all the time. The rumor is that if you say "Keystone XL" three times under a full moon, he will appear in front of you.

2015-05-08  | (News Clips)  |               | "Other areas where Sanders is in a position to draw stark contrasts with Clinton include [...] her stance on the Keystone XL pipeline. As secretary of state, Clinton said she was 'inclined' to approve the pipeline. Since then, much like on the trade measure, Clinton has been silent on Keystone."
2015-05-11  | (News Clips)  |               | "Sanders is hesitant to criticize Clinton, saying that he respects and admires her. But pressed on the question of why he would make a better Democratic nominee, he points to three things [including] the work he has done opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. 'I'm not quite sure Hillary Clinton has come out with a position on that' he said."
2015-05-15  | (News Clips)  |               | On comparing Sanders and Clinton: "Bill McKibben, who founded 350.org and has led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, says he is confident Sanders understands the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Sanders has opposed Keystone, while Clinton has avoided taking a position on it. 'He's been the most consistent and proactive voice in the entire Keystone fight,' writes McKibben in an email."

Should the State Department issue the Presidential permit for this project? (Or if the State Dept decision has been announced by the time of the luncheon, what are your views on the decision?)."

2015-05-15  | (News Clips)  |               | "Among them, Schweizer says in the original version of the book that TD Bank, a major shareholder in the Keystone XL pipeline, paid Bill Clinton for speeches and then said it would 'begin selling its $1.6 billion worth of shares in the massive but potentially still-born [sic] Keystone XL crude pipeline project' after Hillary Clinton left office. But as his source on the sale of TD Bank’s shares, Schweizer used a press release that was revealed to be fake in 2013."-->
