2015-02-27  | John Podesta          |               | "Doubt [Tom Steyer] will ask [Hillary Rodham Clinton] to say something on Keystone, but I suppose that's possible."
2015-04-11  | New Republic          | @Leber2015a   | Little is known about [Hillary Clinton's] specific policies on the environment. She's never tweeted about climate change, and she’s steered clear of debates over the Keystone XL pipeline. "You won’t get me to talk about Keystone because I have steadily made clear that I’m not going to express an opinion," Clinton said in Canada the same week the Senate debated a Keystone bill. So far, the most promising sign that her campaign will be aggressive on the environment is her hiring former White House senior adviser John Podesta, who led the Obama administration’s recent strategy on climate.
2015-04-19  | Brian Fallon          | @Brian2015a   | "The enviros may latch onto this going forward. Have we discussed when she will come out against Keystone? After POTUS vetoes?"
2015-05-15  | Bill McKibben*        | @Adler2015    | Bill McKibben, who founded 350.org and has led the fight to stop the Keystone XL pipeline, says he is confident Sanders understands the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Sanders has opposed Keystone, while Clinton has avoided taking a position on it. "He’s been the most consistent and proactive voice in the entire Keystone fight," writes McKibben in an email.
2015-05-17  | Bill McKibben         | @Parker2015   | Mr. McKibben’s environmental organization, 350.org, has been trying to raise awareness about the ties it sees between lobbyists for the oil pipeline and former aides to Mrs. Clinton.
2015-07-11  | Tiernan Sittenfeld    | @Sullivan2015a| "[I]t’s hard to imagine we [the League of Conservation Voters] can move forward [with an endorsement] until she makes clear she now opposes KXL."
2015-07-12  | POLITICO              | @Schor2015    |  Many of [the anti-KXL] activists are without a standard-bearer in the Democratic field, and are still suspicious of Clinton because of her refusal to rule out the Keystone project. And they’ve demonstrated the capacity to put supporters in the streets, including more than 1,100 anti-Keystone protesters who went to jail after White House sit-ins four years ago. That’s offering an opening to the progressive Sanders, who has emerged as Clinton’s top rival in the polls, and O’Malley, whose once-promising campaign has yet to gain traction. [...] Sanders even launched his candidacy at an event with fellow Vermonter Bill McKibben, the activist who rose to prominence by leading the anti-Keystone crusade as part of the campaign to fight climate change.
2015-07-20  | Jamie Henn (350.org)  | @Goodman2015  | "We all remember when Clinton said she was 'inclined' to approve Keystone XL. If the pipeline goes through, she'll shoulder part of the blame, and this protest today will be just a small taste of actions to come. Clinton is saying many of the right things on climate - Keystone XL is an easy way to start doing the right thing."
2015-07-20  |Jane Kleeb (Bold Nebraska)|@Goodman2015| "Activists who are the ones that will turn out for her events and donate money are the ones who will also see the gap of her talking about climate change and yet (if she does) supporting tar sands and fracking. [Clinton] needs to visit with us and hopefully not listen to some of the DC lobbyists who I just know are saying 'they will vote for you anyway, what other option do they have?'"
2015-07-27  | The New Republic      | @Leber2015    | Climate Hawks Vote said in a statement that "Clinton’s climate plan is remarkable for what it does’t say, yet: no effort to keep fossil fuels in the ground, no price on carbon; no word on Keystone XL, Arctic oil, or other carbon bombs; no word on fracking; no call for adaptation."
2015-09-22 |Tiernan Sittenfeld (LCV)|@Sittenfeld2015| "We are thrilled that Secretary Clinton has continued to build on her longtime environmental leadership by publicly opposing the dirty and dangerous Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. This is exactly the kind of leadership we need in order to leave a healthy planet for our children and grandchildren. It is more clear than ever that pumping the dirtiest oil on the planet across America’s heartland so that it can be shipped overseas would take our country in the exact wrong direction. Secretary Clinton’s recent clean energy proposal, coupled with her opposition to drilling in the Arctic Ocean and now to Keystone XL, is both inspiring and exciting."
2015-09-23  | 350.org               | @Boeve2015    | "Make no mistake: today is clear proof that social movements move politics. Thanks to thousands of dedicated activists around the country who spent years putting their bodies on the line to protect our climate, we’ve taken [Hillary Rodham Clinton's] 'inclination to approve' Keystone XL, and turned it into yet another call for rejection. Her position on Keystone should set an important precedent for her policies going forward: we cannot afford to approve projects that make climate change worse."
2015-11-06  | Dan Weiss (LCV)       |               | "Thank you for your leadership against KXL. Beginning [with] your Canada speech 5.5 years ago! Your vision & leadership helped lead the way…again."
2015-11-06  | John Podesta          |               | (Responding to email from Dan Weiss of the League of Conservation Voters on his 5.5 year leadership against KXL) "Thanks Dan. Walk down memory lane."

\* Take note of this guy, he manages to get his name into the news all the time. The rumor is that if you say "Keystone XL" three times under a full moon, he will appear in front of you.

2015-08-05  | New York Times        | @Eidelson2015 | Terry O'Sullivan, president of LIUNA in an open letter to O'Malley: "[Rejecting KXL is] an attack on the jobs of thousands of members of the Laborers International Union of North America. [...] It is absurd pandering to extremist and elitist elements within the environmental movement"
2015-08-09  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | "I am monitoring the Keystone announcement and am in connection with policy on the issue related to the building trades."
2015-08-12  | Amanda Renteria       |               | "Can we make sure that [Labor outreach] sees the statement [on KXL] before it goes out? Just want to make sure we don't catch anyone by surprise. We are so close to getting [building] trades and if we do this right, it will be ok even though they won't like it."
2015-08-23  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | "I think with the trades one of the most important things is to provide [the building trades unions] a heads up, even if we’re going to be in different places [on KXL]. Not surprising I know, but the [building] trades are going to go nuclear (so to speak) on the Administration once this announcement [on the KXL permit decision] comes out."
2015-08-23  | Maya Harris           |               | "Defer to John [Podesta] and Jake [Sullivan] on whether [KXL announcement] can hold until after Sept 9 Building Trades [unions] meeting."
2015-08-27  | Gordon Giffin         |               | "[A]s you probably know there is a federal election campaign ongoing in Canada. The election is October 19. It would be prudent, I believe wearing my former ambassador hat, to avoid being seen to take a position on a high profile issue [Keystone XL] that could be argued to be intervention in that election."
2015-09-07  | Kristina Costa        |               | "The current thinking is to have [Hillary Rodham Clinton] address [our position on KXL] in her meeting with the building trades [unions] on Wednesday and roll out the fact sheet and op-ed in conjunction with that."
2015-09-09  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | "LIUNA: First regarding KXL, we should not be surprised if LIUNA still puts out a critical statement in response to our statement when it goes out. I expect it to be measured though. LIUNA is in a better place this afternoon then when we started the day. The meeting with HRC was helpful and appreciated by their side. They will not endorse anyone else but it is likely they will not endorse early in the primary. You might even notice them reaching out to Republicans, that is for show. I feel more confident today that we will actually get them down the road then I ever have. I will touchbase with their staff tomorrow."
2015-09-09  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | "UA: The Plumbers for reference are already on the Priorities board. They are the only union that proactively called me after the meeting to follow up on Keystone. They want to endorse Monday but don’t want to do that immediately after our Keystone statement. UA is one of the four unions impacted by a Keystone decision. They will likely give a little breathing room between our KXL statement and their endorsement but they are on board. I’m coordinating timing with staff."

2015-08-07  | TransCanada           | @Panetta2015a | "One expert said he'd advise the company to hold off, and hope a more pipeline-friendly administration takes office in 2017. The U.S. government has a 13-0 record in NAFTA cases. A suit would likely fail, cost the company a few million dollars, and possibly antagonize the U.S. government, said David Gantz, who was been [sic] a panelist on NAFTA cases and who teaches trade law at the University of Arizona."
2015-09-07  | Kristina Costa        |               | "Joel, we pumped up the climate impacts but in discussing with Jake [Sullivan] decided we do still need to address why she’s making her position known, when she has previously said she will wait for the President to make a decision. Added a line about wanting to let voters know where she stands, and added a more expansive graf about making the US the leader in fighting climate change and becoming a clean energy superpower."
2015-09-09  | John Podesta          |               | (An email to sombody in the White House) "[Hillary Rodham Clinton]" just told the Building Trades she is against Keystone. Didn't want to get a bunch of endorsements and then surprise them with that. It was respectfully received. We assume that will leak, but haven’t settled on how or whether to put that out. I wanted you to know for POTUS purposes but please don't share with the office next door."
2015-09-21  | Mandy Grunwal         |               | "If we weren’t hitting the Administration [White House] with Keystone this week, I might be tempted, but I think that probably makes it a bad idea."
2015-09-22  | Malia Fisher          |               | "Mark Murray pointing out that with the WH still undecided, HRC's position puts BIden [sic] in a bind with enviro left."

2015-04-22  | John Podesta          |               | (In an email to Jake Sullivan) "Are you ready for a keystone announcement [by the White House] tomorrow? Have no knowledge, but can't figure out why he's headed to the everglades."
2014-04-22  | Jake Sullivan         |               | (Responding to the above email by John Podesta) "I've heard May 28 (timed to [US Senate] recess)."
2015-05-12  | Eryn Sepp             |               | (In an email with potential interview questions for John Podesta) What are your views on the Keystone XL pipeline? Should the State Department issue the Presidential permit for this project? (Or if the State Dept decision has been announced by the time of the luncheon, what are your views on the decision?).
2015-05-18  | Peter "Pete" Ogden    |               | "Jake [Sullivan] asked that I share this memo with you on a potential response to the KXL decision. We heard a rumor that a decision could come as early as this Thursday, though had previously heard it would not be made until next week."
2015-07-28  | Jesse Ferguson        |               | "Sam Frizell (Time) is wondering if Podesta is advising HRC on Keystone policy. Noting that Podesta recused himself from advising the WH/POTUS on Keystone, since he was already opposed, Sam is asking about his status advising HRC on the issue."
2015-07-28  | Senator John Hoven    | @Snyder2015   | A leading congressional supporter of the Keystone XL pipeline predicted President Barack Obama will reject the US$8-billion project when Congress is out of town in August. Senator John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, cited "sources" Tuesday as he discussed the pipeline in a Senate floor speech without identifying where he got his information. "What I'm hearing from multiple sources is that he is going to turn down Keystone when we're out in August," Hoeven told Bloomberg BNA's Ari Natter after the speech. "I got a couple sources, and that's what they're saying. But I can't tell you who." [...] Hoeven said on the Senate floor that Obama would wait until the August recess because the timing would mean less "pushback" from Congress.
2015-07-28  | Josh Saks, NWF        | @Snyder2015   | "We're confident President Obama will reject the Keystone XL tarsands pipeline based on his own criteria that it not increase climatedisrupting carbon pollution--the only question is when that decision will come"
2015-08-09  | CBC                   | @Panetta2015  | A source involved in the [KXL] project said the company is consulting lawyers on the mechanics of a NAFTA challenge, and weighing the legal and political implications. He said the main suspense now is how Obama will make his big announcement--quietly, in a mid-summer Friday afternoon statement, or boldly from a platform like his upcoming Aug. 31 trip to a climate-change conference in Alaska. "There's a broad acceptance that the decision's been made," he said, adding that different White House employees had suggested a rejection's coming. "The rumour is that the decision to deny has been made, and they're just waiting for the right time and venue."
2015-08-14  | Dan Schwerin          | @Schwerin2015a| (In response to a rumor that permit will be denied on Aug 24 or 25) "Fwd: TWEET: Rumor POTUS says no to KXL in Vegas. well [sic] this would be great"
2015-08-18  | John Podesta          |               | "Now if POTUS would finally kill Keystone all could be good in the kingdom."
2015-08-21  |Mike Dorning (Bloomberg)|              | (In an email to John Podesta) "re. Keystone. We're hearing decision likely next week, all indications point to rejection. Editors are very anxious to break story. Appreciate anything you share anonymously re. What decision is or when it will come."
2015-08-21  | Jake Sullivan         |               | (In response to a question by Maya Harris whether the plan is to take a stance on KXL only after the permit decision is made) "If rumors are true that it will be next week or week after then yes."
2015-08-23  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | "The Building Trades are flagging for me that they hear the Obama Administration will deny KXL on Monday. I just wanted to try to politically get ahead of this and where we are on the issue if this in fact happens. The trades are also hearing that [Hillary Rodham Clinton] will put out a statement stating that she encouraged Obama to take this position. Politically with the building trades, this would be a very dangerous posture."
2015-08-23  | Pete Ogden            |               | "Maybe [the White House] decided to push [the KXL permit decision] until after the Canadian election on 10/19."
2015-09-17  | Barack Obama          | @Feldman2013  | "Now, I know there's been, for example, a lot of controversy surrounding the proposal to build a pipeline, the Keystone pipeline, that would carry oil from Canadian tar sands down to refineries in the Gulf. And the State Department is going through the final stages of evaluating the proposal. That's how it’s always been done. But I do want to be clear: Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nation's interest. And our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution. The net effects of the pipeline’s impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward. It's relevant."
2015-10-29  | Juliet Eilperin (Washington Post) |   | (In an email to John Podesta) "I can’t tell if they’d be more likely to do it before, or after, Trudeau takes office--there would be arguments either way."

2015-03-18  | The Hill              | @Cama2015     | An environmental activist group is filing a request for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private emails regarding the Keystone XL pipeline. Following news that Clinton exclusively used a private email account during her tenure as secretary, Friends of the Earth said some of those communications might reveal important details about the State Department's consideration of Keystone.  
2015-05-14  | Politico              | @Karni2015    | Among [the corrected passages in the book "Clinton Cash"], Schweizer says in the original version of the book that TD Bank, a major shareholder in the Keystone XL pipeline, paid Bill Clinton for speeches and then said it would 'begin selling its $1.6 billion worth of shares in the massive but potentially still-born [sic] Keystone XL crude pipeline project' after Hillary Clinton left office. But as his source on the sale of TD Bank’s shares, Schweizer used a press release that was revealed to be fake in 2013.
2015-05-18  | Jake Sullivan         |               | But it struck me that both reacting to [the KXL permit decision] and having something affirmative to say on North America made good sense. Pitch it forward. Especially if this comes out next week rather than this week--it would be a natural basis for doing a climate-focused event in Florida.
2015-07-11  | WSJ                   | @Meckler2015  | Hillary Clinton’s State Department Staff Kept Tight Rein on Records [...]. In one instance, her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, told State Department records specialists she wanted to see all documents requested on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and later demanded that some be held back.
2015-07-18  | Huffington Post       |@Blumenthal2015| Hillary Clinton’s Biggest Campaign Bundlers Are Fossil Fuel Lobbyists [...]. Bundler Gordon Giffin is a former lobbyist for TransCanada, the company working to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. Giffin sits on the board of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, an investor in the pipeline. The Canadian bank paid Clinton \\\$990,000 for speeches in the months leading up to her presidential announcement. Another Canadian financial institution with an interest in Keystone XL, TD Bank, paid her \\\$651,000 for speaking engagements.
2015-07-27  | Tiernan Sittenfeld    |               | "I assume this will be a surprise to none of you, but the tar sands listserve just lit up about Sec. Clinton's comments on KXL in [Iowa] today. And apparently, Ed Shultz will be discussing on his show today. As you know, we are continuing to push for a rejection [by Hillary Clinton] asap. Can't come soon enough!"
2015-08-07  | Gordon D. Giffin      |               | "I note from the press accounts that Sec. Clinton may be considering a more direct statement on the pending permit application for the KXL pipeline. I have a few thoughts to share for your consideration."
2015-09-07  | Amanda Renteria       |               | "Fyi - she will lean into this on wed in a labor exec mtg. It could end up leaking. So we def want to get [the Energy infrastructure fact sheet & KXL oped] ready."

2015-09-08  | Brian Fallon          |               | "Given that we just offered an apology on [the Hillary Clinton email controversy] that some reporters think happened 'on a dime' after months of resistance, do we worry that publishing an oped that leans this aggressively into our newfound position on Keystone will be greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity? I think we could seem consistent with our past statements about not wanting to get ahead of POTUS on Keystone if her position merely leaked out of the labor meeting. That would seem like a private comment that she didn't intend to become public — to an unfriendly audience, no less — and so it might achieve the same effect of getting her on the record on this issue, but with less perception that she is putting a finger to the wind. I just worry that announcing our position so fulsomely in an oped amounts to leading with our chin and will inspire loud cries of hypocrisy from reporters."
2015-09-08  | Jim Margolis          |               | "[What Brian Fallon said in the quote above] has been bothering me as well. We repeatedly said we couldn’t [take a stance on KXL] and then launch an op Ed [sic] without much explanation."
2015-09-08  | Joel Benenson         |               | "How [language less bold] help us? We are have [sic] been challenged for not having a position and being strong in opposing is essential. Vague or less than clear direct language will reinforce weakness instead of showing strength. I think the graph as written lacks any impact, is circuitous and her statement needs to be super strong to get us past the fact that she hadn’t taken a position."
2015-09-09  | Nick Merrill          |               | "I wholeheartedly agree with [the quote above by Brian Fallon]. I just don’t see how this won’t come off as incredibly disingenuous, and I fear the crowd we are looking to placate is exactly the crowd that is most predisposed to seeing this move as purely political. We solve one problem and create another with the very same crowd, while upsetting those on the other side in the process. The irony of all of this is that while not recognized as such, her not taking a position is a pretty risky and honest move, particularly for so long. She was trying to respect the process and the WH. That’s honorable even if we can never sell it that way. So while I’m not sure we should say we’re against it to a labor crowd that supports it, I really like the original plan of telling a sympathetic group and being ready when it leaks."

<!--2015-08-23  | Nikki Budzinski       |               | 2. Could we include the terminology around "current baseload needs" in the current energy economy in both the fact sheet and Op Ed? This will at least tip the hat to where we are today with the acknowledgement that we are transitioning to green.-->

They really bristle at that. Could we mention that these are "jobs and careers" for many workers and as we transition [Hillary Rodham Clinton] wants to create more careers within the new energy economy? Careers is their buzz word. 5. As I mention above, the Trades will attack Obama on raising energy prices, could [Hillary Rodham Clinton]’s OpEd and Fact sheet mention that she wants to see protections for consumers for those potential rising prices? The Op Ed will be read as very celebratory, and maybe that’s it. But I think if we could incorporate a little of these suggestions above and tone, it could be helpful."

As secretary of state, Clinton said she was "inclined" to approve the pipeline. Since then, much like on the [Trans-Pacific Partnership], Clinton has been silent on Keystone.
2015-05-10  | CBS News              | @Kaplan2015   | Sanders is hesitant to criticize Clinton, saying that he respects and admires her. But pressed on the question of why he would make a better Democratic nominee, he points to three things [including] the work he has done opposing the Keystone XL pipeline. "I'm not quite sure Hillary Clinton has come out with a position on that," he said.
2015-05-30  | Wall Street Journal   | @Meckler2015a | On policy, [O'Malley] has taken several positions to Mrs. Clinton’s left and is hoping to convince voters she is too centrist for today’s Democratic Party. He favors breaking up big banks, killing a pending Pacific Rim trade deal, expanding Social Security benefits and rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline. She has sidestepped these issues or remained silent.
2015-06-16  | The Daily Beast       | @Clift2015    | [Sanders] wants to know what "the Secretary" [Hillary Rodham Clinton] thinks about the Keystone pipeline. He led the fight against it and believes climate change is a "planetary crisis."
2015-07-27  | Slate                 | @Voorhees2015 | [This is a brief summary of the Clinton campaigns climate plans] and how they stack up against the plans already put forth by Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley [...]. But on the strictly political side of the equation [...] Clinton’s proposal is clever. She's telling Americans what she'll add--rooftop solar for more than 25 million homes!--without having to faddress the more politically fraught conversation of what she’s willing to subtract. Notably missing from the policy rollout was any mention of blocking Keystone XL, the controversial pipeline that has become a high-profile litmus test for the climate crowd[...].
2021-08-31  | Bernie Sanders        | @Tapper2015   | "I believe along with Pope Francis and almost all scientists that climate change is threatening this planet in a horrendous ways and that we have to be aggresive in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and defeat--and defeat!--the Keystone pipeline. That is not Hillary Clinton's position."
2015-09-23  | Jesse Lehrich         |               | "Martin O'Malley responded more aggressively [to her KXL announcement], claiming that [Hillary Rodham Clinton] is not a leader and that on one issue after the next, she's made her decisions out of convenience nad not conviction."
2015-11-05  | Bernie Sanders        | @Linskey2015  | [Bernie Sanders] pointed to [Hillary Rodham Clinton's] recent decision to oppose the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, an issue that was being studied by the State Department when she was in charge of it. 'How many years do you have to think about whether or not we excavate and transport the dirtiest fuel in the world?' he said. 'It didn’t take me too long to think about that.'

Therefore, I oppose it. And I oppose it because I don’t think it’s in the best interest of what we need to do to combat climate change. I will be rolling out in a few days my plan for a North American approach to fighting climate change and clean energy. Because for me, we need to be transitioning from fossil fuels—I know it will take time--to clean renewable energy."
