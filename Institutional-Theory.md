## One-paragraph summary
[[Meyer and Rowan 1977]] as well as [[DiMaggio and Powell 1983]] opened this discourse by putting into question the presumption of efficient bureaucracy and exploring the antecedents of bureaucratization. At its core, Institutional Theory studies how at times choices on firm characteristics are determined by the environment (structure), e.g. peers' characteristics, rather than (agentic) efficiency concerns. At different times, authors took different approaches to balancing agency and structure. [[DiMaggio and Powell 1983]] for instance hold that rational actors consciously succumb to the isomorphic pressure to gain certain benefits, whereas [[Oliver 1991]] explains that actors can, when they are aware of institutional pressure, use various strategies to defy this pressure.
