## One-paragraph summary
Clarifying the learning curve model: what are the theoretical underpinnings, and how should the learning curve function be stated. With regard to the theoretical underpinnings, Baloff states finds that "the role played by engineers and indirect-labor personnel in facilitating [...] increases in productivity has not been adequately recognized [...]" (Baloff 1966, 276). In other words, learning and the learning curve goes beyond workers getting better at their assigned task ('manual learning'). Baloff points to Conway and Schultz (1959) who have found that the learning curve is also applicable to machine-intensive production, where learning of workers can be assumed to have less of an, or no impact on productivity. In these areas, it is the 'cognitive' learning of engineers and managers that constitutes the learning that takes place. In the second part of his article, Baloff observes that previous formalizations of the learning curve's formula have been inconsistent. He suggests that an exponential relationship exists between cumulative output and manufacturing productivity (with an intercept a and an exponent b, which both need to be estimated), until a certain plateau is reached.
