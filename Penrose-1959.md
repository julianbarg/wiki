## One-page summary
The book chapters explain the fundamental arguments presented in form of a theory of the growth of the firm. The first chapter provides a brief introduction of the basic theory, the second chapter clarifies the definition of the firm, and the third chapter (chapter 5) explains the relationship between inherited resources and the direction of expansion. The underlying thread in the book is that we need a theory of growth of the firm, the firm which is beyond its economic definition, and is not constrained to produce just one product; it would always have underutilized product services, and the motive to make good use of it will keep the firm growing. 

The introductory chapter starts with an exploration of the term "growth" in context of strategic management, where apart from the traditional economic definition of growth, it also means improvement in quality as a result of a process of development. The theory of growth of the firm views size as a by-product of the process of growth, and hence there is no optimum or most profitable size of the firm. The author also criticizes the biological analogies of the firm, which ignores human motivation, and conscious human decision in the process of growth. Taking the arguments to the level of resources, the authors posit that the resources shape productive services, and the experience of management will also affect the productive services the resources are capable of offering. So, the demand for the product as seen by the firm is largely conditioned by the progressive services available, and hence the direction of innovation is influenced by the inherited resources. The author also argues that the limit to the size and growth of the firm that was traditionally considered due the extensive reliance on owner / entrepreneur was removed by adaptation of the corporation. From this point, the author further presses that it is the whole firm, and not only top management, that is important for examinations of the theory of the growth of the firm.  

The second chapter focuses on the concept of the firm. In any industry, the firm is a basic unit for the organization of production. However, the concept of firm is very ambiguous, especially as it is not a physical object which can be distinctly identified. Because of the diversity, and complexity, the firm can be explored through sociological, organizational, engineering, as well as economic analysis. Within economics, the concept of the firm, as defined in the theory of the firm, is often misunderstood, and misapplied. The economic theory of the firm addresses the basic problem of price determination and resource allocation. Since the theory is concerned with determining the price of a particular product / services, the model it relies on is the model depicting predictors of prices and quantities of a specific product. In the same lines, the growth of a firm would mean growth of the *output of a given product*. Implicitly, the model, and hence the theory is not designed to analyze a firm that freely varies the kinds of the products it produces as it grows. On the same token, economists have also considered the firm to be limited in its size due to increase in long run cost of production or drops in revenue. The limitations of this conceptualization are the assumption of management being a fixed factor, and the firm being tied to specific products and markets. In the real world this is not the case, and hence to analyze such real world situation, one needs to adopt a different concept of the firm. A firm that can produce anything for which a demand can be found or created, given availability of appropriate resources. 

When viewed as a growing organization, the firm becomes more than just a price-and-output decision maker. This is the firm as it is viewed at by businessman, an administrative organization. The primary function of the firm is to make use of productive resources for the purpose of supplying products on the market. The firm is an autonomous administrative planning unit, which is governed by the central managerial direction, the central management. In terms of the size of the firm, the traditional notion has been that the limited cognitive capacity of humans will limit the size of the firm, as they will no longer be able to make effective decisions (in the short-run, as well as long-run) to run the administrative function of the firm. However, the distributed decision making makes it possible to overcome this limitation of an individual's cognitive capacity. At present time, it cannot be said that large firms are inefficient in organizing. Which also calls for a different analysis to be undertaken for large firms.

At the same time, the firm is also a collection of productive resources. Hence, the size of the firm can be gauged by the productive resources – physical, as well as human - it employs. Though, the resources themselves are not enough, it is the services these resources can render that matter. The resources consist of a bundle of potential services. Fixed assets are generally considered for the calculation of size of the firm, which has its own limitations. The author however posits the long run profits, and consequently the growth as the motivation of the firm.

Finally, the third chapter provides an account of relationship between inherited resources and the direction of expansion for the firm. The author explains various internal as well as external, inducements vis-à-vis obstacles to growth. The core argument of the chapter is the preposition that there would always be unused productive services within a firm, and the motive to make a good use of it leads to the growth of the firm. It is never possible that firm would not have resources / services in slack which cannot be put to better use, because of three things: indivisibility of resources, same resources can be used for multiple purposes, and ordinary processes of operations always creates new productive services. The author further argues that demand for products is subjective in nature, as perfect competition never exists. The firm influences this demand by its own actions. It is the entrepreneur’s own ideas about what he can sell at various prices with varying degrees of selling effort, then we ought to consider what influences the development of those ideas. the ideas are largely influenced by the historic resources available to the firm. So, the growth path of the firm is dependent on the resources it inherits. The firm will try to use the existing resource more efficiently, and for doing so, will try to develop new markets. The unused productive services then becomes competitive advantage, and incentive to expand for the firm.  

In term of the boundary conditions, the author mentions that she is not concerned with the firms which do not grow. So, the theory is not predictive in the sense that it cannot predict the growth. But given that the firm can grow, the theory explains what governs that growth, and at what pace it can grow. In my view, this is a limitation of the theory that constraints its ability to predict. Also, by not looking at the firms which do not grow, one may be missing out on the information, and may be ignorant of some endogenous problems, being wrongly associated with growth.  Secondly, this view is very inward looking. It may explain the bricolage (Garud and Krampe 2003) strategy adopted by firms, but it may not explain the breakthrough strategy in the same spirit. When one moves from the market and products to resources, it comes with a cost of ignorance of the market forces.  

Some questions I believe worth posing are: Is there a possibility for two firms having similar resources (including the inherited ones) following different growth trajectory? If so, what explains this difference? If one considers the firms that grow, as well as the firms that don’t grow in the analysis (unlike the present theory which is focused on the firms that grow), will we still find the resources as significant explanatory variables of growth? Has the situation changed in last 60 odd years after the book was first written? Are the inherited resources as important as they were before? There are some examples in technology sector worth pondering. For instance, when Amazon took over Whole Foods, can this growth decision be considered leveraging their inherited resources, or leveraging their strength in the market? When banks start separate innovation labs (e.g. Scotia Bank Digital Factory), by recruiting fresh talent from the market -which has much different organizational structure / culture than the rest of the firm, as well as the other resources being totally different – are they following the path-dependent growth trajectory, or are they are trying to break the path to facilitate innovation?
