#### Introduction

1. Set up the basic conflict–engineers vs. activists. Who is wrong?

* The engineers have convincing technological solutions
* If you claim "the next spill will come"–that is definitively true (but is it also not very profound)

2. But how do we approach this thing?
* There is reason to believe that pipelines would improve
* There is reason to believe that pipelines would not improve
* Engineers can rightfully point to technological improvements that have been made
* To explain why pipelines are still unsafe requires some more work

3. Why are pipelines still unsafe, despite learning taking place?
* (In it's current state) organizational learning addresses very specific problems
* Organizational learning, in general, is conceptualized in a wrong fashion

4. How should we conceptualize learning?
* The "traditional" conceptualization of learning is simplistic
* Many things are meshed in there, many of which do not constitute learning as we would think about it
* Rather than a learning curve, there is a transition from state to state taking place
* A small number of specific goals determines what states an organization strives toward (or if a change of state is seeked)
* When we talk about pipeline spills, learning (at least over the last 30 years) is taking place in response to specific exogenous demands (that are reactions to spills that have taken place)

#### Who is learning--who is not?

#### What would theory say? Why is theory flawed?

#### Choice and outcomes in qualitative data

* E.g., how a perception of a major incident was avoided where the attention was not there.
