## Motivations

(Learning) Move organizational learning into postmodernity.

(Sustainability) Move attention away from ESG data, toward noise.

(Sustainability) Following a risk taking approach, simpler is better.

#### Introduction

1. Set up the basic conflictâ€“engineers vs. activists. Who is wrong?
* The engineers have convincing technological solutions
* If you claim "the next spill will come"--that is definitively true (but is it also not very profound)

2. But how do we approach this thing?
* There is reason to believe that pipelines would improve
* There is reason to believe that pipelines would not improve
* Engineers can rightfully point to technological improvements that have been made
* To explain why pipelines are still unsafe requires some more work

3. Why are pipelines still unsafe, despite learning taking place?
* (In its current state) organizational learning addresses very specific problems
* Organizational learning, in general, is conceptualized in a wrong fashion

4. How should we conceptualize learning?
* The "traditional" conceptualization of learning is simplistic
* Many things are meshed in there, many of which do not constitute learninge as we would think about it (such as capital investment--we are conflating two things if we include that)
* Rather than a learning curve, there is a transition from state (/Gestalt?) to state taking place
        * The change in state is not instantaneous, thus giving the impression of curves--but really it is a qualitative change (here, pushing against the notion of "better")
* A small number of specific goals determines what states an organization strives toward (or if a change of state is seeked)
* When we talk about pipeline spills, learning (at least over the last 30 years) is taking place in response to specific exogenous demands (that are reactions to spills that have taken place)
* This process is not one of accumulating knowledge. Of the following points, do not cover everything in introduction--communicate the spirit!
        * One can learn the same routine multiple times if there is enough time between it--i.e., inbetween, organizations learn that the routine is not needed, and drop it
        * If an organization was to maintain every routine it has ever learned, it would quickly be succumbed by overhead
        * There may exist alternative states or though--radically different regimes--that fulfill very different sets of goals (March 1999). For instance, US vs. Japanese rail network

5. What are the implications of that?
* For learning:
        * Importance of difference between specific progress (NTSB reports) vs. overall progress--looking at the data to discover
        * If progress is not made on an issue, goal-setting can be a solution
        * Looking at postmodern approaches in sociology for inspiration
* For sustainability:
        * Hoping for technological progression alone to solve our problems is unreasonable
        * If certain problems cannot be resolved, easier solutions should be preferred
        * If progress is to be made on an issue, goal-setting is a crucial process. Analyzing and resolving specific issues can be a cat-and-mouse game. Goals that lead to systemic changes can make a difference, but may require high upfront cost and offer no success guarantee (again, Japanese rail network; for pipelines: responding to every alarm might be prohibitively expensive--and startup processes are dangerous, too!)

#### First chapter: learning is more specific than previously assumed

**Function**: through data, show the limitation of learning. 

**RQ**: The industry has the most formidable technology, why hasn't the technology accomplished what it set out to do?

1. Show examples of the technology that is used in the pipeline industry and how they address certain issues
2. Show how pipeline spills are still prevalent, despire these historic breakthroughs
3. Using a few incidents, show the heterogeneity of spills
* Almost no two spills are alike
* The technology does not get at the specific problems, it is too universal, inapplicable
4. As a result, instances of spills reduce the subsequent occurence of similar spills
5. But because spills are so heterogenous, the overall incidence of spills is not significantly reduced
* Does new technology maybe lead to new kinds of problems? Then, continuous new creation of technology would also create new problems
* But the fundamental workings of pipelines are barely touched upon
6. Overall: consider this to apply to a broad range of contexts, especially those where task diversity is high. Less so in industrial production, maybe between generations/specifications of products though
7. Putting into question our general perception of progress. Technological innovation does not necessarily touch on problems, the scope of lessons learned is (depending on the context) much smaller than believed.
* Especially if there could be forces working in the other direction

#### Second chapter: What would theory say? Why is theory flawed?

1. Explore knowledge-based learning literature, roughly following Argote (1999)

2. Explore learning as laid out in BTOF research stream

3. Pick some good (qualitative) example of learning as different states rather than curve 
* Introduction of robots in assembly lines--revolution not evolution!
* Technological and management choices
* CPUs--how generations give off the impressions of curves

4. What is my purpose for doing this:
* Understand why despite clear technological progress, many of our problems and limitations are still not addressed
* Explain why despite technological progress, organizations can fall behind what they were capable of before

#### Third chapter: How to talk about issues without addressing the problems (qual)

Choice and outcomes in qualitative data

How does technology feed into ceremonial learning?

Maybe a more refined version of fantasy documents? And of reliability/validity story?

What is it that I saw in my data that I really want other people to see?
* My qualitative data shows why there is no progress
* I have to argue that intention does not matter (then, I don't  need data that shows true intention)

* E.g., how a perception of a major incident was avoided where the attention was not there.

#### Conclusion

* Same as introduction #5--implications?

##### What I am excluding

* How failures/disasters get normalized (i.e., fieldwork).
* Pipeline industry not employing highly specialized graduates that might be available. Technology not operated by experts, but by the cheapest that are arguably still somehow qualified?
* Oil industry not being profitable in the first place. Esp. tax credits for unsuccessful drills & shale gas & environmental damages.
* Directional drillings solving some problems, but leading to new kinds of pollution of acquifiers.
* Acceptable risk kind of story--rail used as justification for pipeline (and even that is questionable).
