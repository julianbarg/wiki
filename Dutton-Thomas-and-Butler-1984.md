## One-paragraph summary
A lot of the research on progress functions (to this point) has been undertaken by engineers.

Studies both articles that seek to isolate causal factors ("T" studies), and prescriptive studies ("A" studies). Also explores the possibility that learning curve is self-fulfilling strategy. My thought: would it be possible, for instance, that organizations, once they reach a certain level from which progress is difficult to achieve, lower their standards to achieve this progress on the learning curve?
