## Topic

**Who we manpulate outselves, and how we manipulate others. Rediscovering the spectrum.**

> McCoy: Did we aggresively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science? Absolutely not. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that's true. But there is nothing illegal about that. You know, we were looking out for our investments. You know, we were looking out for our shareholders. [...] And you're not going to be able to just switch to battery operated vehicles or wind for your electricity. And just having that conversation around why that's not possible in the next ten years is critically important to the work that we do. And that's in every phase. That's in the Senate, that's in the House. That's with the administration. [...] Or something like climate change. There is forest fires. There is an increase of, you know, .001 Celsius. That does not affect people's everyday lives. [...]

> McCoy: Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans. And the cynical side of me says 'yeah, we kind of know that.' But it gives us a talking point that we can say: 'well, what is ExxxonMobil for?'--'well, we're for a carbon tax.' [...]
>
> Carter: What you said was just really interesting. So it's basically never going to happen--right?--is the calculation?
> 
> McCoy: Yeah. No, it's not going to--carbon tax is not going to happen. [...]
> 
> Carter: So, this helps me understand a little bit why suddenly a lot of US oil majors are talking about a carbon tax. Because, it sounds pretty..."
> 
> McCoy: Well, I... The cynical side of me, they have got nothing else. So, it's an easy talking point to say: 'Look, I'm for a carbon tax.' [...] So, that's the talking point. That is, in my mind, an effective advocacy tool.

> McCoy: We're playing defense because President Biden is talking about this big infrastructure package, and he is going to pay for it by increasing corporate taxes. [...] You stick to highways and bridges then a lot of the negative stuff starts to come out.
>
> Carter: For you guys.
>
> McCoy: Cause there is a germaneness, right? That does not make any sense for a highway bill. Why would you put in something on emissions reductions on [sic] climate change to oil refineries in a highway bill? [...] 
>
> Carter: Who is the crucial guys [sic] for you?
> 
> McCoy: Well, Senator Capito, who chairs the Senate and who is the ranking [most senior] of Environment and Public Works. Joe Manchin--I talk to his office every week. He is the kingmaker on this, because he is a Democrat from West Virginia, which is a very conservative state. So, he is... And he is not shy about--sort of--staking his claim early and completely changing the debate. So on the Democrat side, we look for the moderates on these issues. So it's the Manchins. It's the Sinemas. It's the Testers. [...] [One of the] other ones that aren't talked about is Senator Coons--who is from Delaware--who has a very close relationship with Senator Biden. So we have been working with his office. As a matter of fact, our CEO is talking to him next Tuesday.

> Easley: The executive branch and regulatory team for Exxon had extraordinary success over the last four years, in large part because the [Trump] administration was so predisposed to--you know--to helping. [...]
> 
> Carter: What were the big wins you got out of Trump?
> 
> Easley: (Laughs) You should google 'ExxonMobil announcement' and 'Donald Trump'. So, he live Facebooked from the West Wing our big drill in the Gulf project. He mentioned us in two States of the Union [Addresses]. We were able to get investor-state dispute settlement protection in NAFTA. We were able to rationalize the permit environment and, you know, get tonnes of permits out. I mean--the wins are such that it would difficult to categorize them all. I mean, tax has to be the biggest one, right? The reduction of the corporate rate was, you know, it was probably worth billions to Exxon. So yeah, there were a lot of wins.

> McCoy: We got API [American Petroleum Institute] to pay attention to it. As part of the subcommitte we were able to have it on the agenda on a consistent basis. And then from that, we were able to feed in paper, and some of our research, and talking points to API. And so then the API staff person that worked on that issue, we said, you know: 'Hey Tom, you know, you need to go to the [Capitol] Hill and you need to have a conversation with the committee.' Or 'Tom, can you put together a group of us, and we can have a conversation with the, ehm, with whatever committee'--Environment and Public works, Energy and Commerce committee. Whatever committees were talking about this--'can you get a coalition of us together and have this.' Under the guise of API. So we go in under the umbrella of API. [...] So API goes up the [Capitol] Hill as API with coalitions. They get partners--they try to bring in some other partners such as the National Association of Manufacturers, the US Chamber of Commerce, American Fuels and Petrochemicals associations (AFPM)--which is a natural partner on this because that is the association for refineries.

In June 2021, a Greenpeace-affiliated journalist posed as a recruiter on Zoom and interviewed two high-profile ExxonMobil lobbyists. The interviews provide insights on malicious PR practices that environmental groups have raised concerns about for a while.
