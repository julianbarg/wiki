Manipulation:<br/> scientific discourse | Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science? Absolutely not. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that is true. But there is nothing illegal about that. You know, we were looking out for our investments. You know, we were looking out for our shareholders.
Manipulation:<br/> public discourse     | Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans. And the cynical side of me says 'yeah, we kind of know that.' But it gives us a talking point that we can say: 'well, what is ExxonMobil for?'--'well, we're for a carbon tax.'
Manipulation:<br/> regulatory discourse | You want to be able to go to the chief. And so the chief knows you, and you can go to the chief and say 'look, we have got this issue, we need congressman so-and-so to be able to--to introduce this bill, we need him to make a floor statement, we need him to send the letter.'
Avoidance:<br/> regulatory discourse    | We do not want it to be us to have these conversations, especially in a hearing. It is getting our associations to step in, and have those conversations, and answer those tough questions. And be the--for the lack of a better term--the whipping boy for some of these members of congress. 
Table: **Table 1: Empirical Examples**

* *Note*. Excerpts from a covert interview between Keith McCoy, Senior Director of Federal Relations at ExxonMobil and Lawrence Carter of Unearthed who poses as a recruiter [@Carter2021; @Carter2021a; @Thomson2021]. Unearthed is an investigative journalism project by Greenpeace UK. Full transcriped interview at <http://wiki.jbarg.net/ExxonMobil%20lobbyist%20interviews.md>.

This month, Congress is taking aim at the oil industry. It is the scene that the industry wanted to avoid (see Table 1): oil executives, lining up on zoom instead of on a bench, being cross-examined by lawmakers. A scene reminiscent of the 1994 tobacco industry hearing that heralded the downfall of "big tobacco". The fossil fuel hearing was preceded by two two ominous events. First, research highlighted that ExxonMobil and Total executives gained a good understanding of climate change in the 1980s, before purposely channel money to a so-called climate "shadow group" to undermine climate action in the 1990s [@Supran2017; @Supran2020; @Bonneuil2021]. And then, the "smoking gun": an investigative journalist coaxed a senior ExxonMobil lobbyist into a fake interview. The interview revealed the strategy behind many of the oil giants lobbying and advocacy activities (see table 1).

This case of climate misinformation is one that a researcher in the field would be unlikely to encounter, an extreme context [@Hallgren2018]. There is an air of illegality. If approached, a manager at one of the indicted companies would do well to claim innocence, for instance by feigning ignorance. That resulting data would then lend itself to either a decoupling, or to a symbolic management interpretation of the data by the research. 

However, now our context has been tossed into the center of attention. The anthropocene has arrived on the stage and it directs our attention at what is unsustainable [@Ergene2020]. A few industries play disproportional roles, such as mining, chemical, industrialized agriculture and fishing, and in particular the fossil fuel industry. ExxonMobil may be an extreme case, but it has become an important case--in the fossil fuel industry, emissions are highly concentrated [@Griffin2017]. In other words, what ExxonMobil, the actions of one company, can have global consequences.

## The first step toward disambiguation: Putting manipulation back onto the spectrum

What strands of research could help us to disambiguate the actions of ExxonMobil, of the tobacco industry before it? And, just to drive home that this is not an isolated phenomenon, how about the discourse on pesticide use [@Maguire2009], or on resource extraction in indigenous lands [@Whiteman2016;@Banerjee2008].

There are different strands of empirical research that could talk to the question at hand, the three most fitting of which we shall cover briefly. All three of them have mostly landed in the middle of the road on Oliver's spectrum. (1) The decoupling literature touches on companies lying--"faking it"--but focuses mostly on those with good intentions who "muddle through" [@Crilly2012; @Bromley2012]. (2) The greenwashing literature calls out gaps between reporting and reality, but more than on manipulation and misinformation it focuses on the many reasons for discrepancies that are out of a company's control [@Lyon2015]. 

\(3) Finally, the management literature more widely has turned to climate change. Climate change is a relatively centralized phenomenon, with the top 50 fossil fuel companies accounting for roughly 50% of global emissions [@Griffin2017]. The focus of research however is more on EverydayCorp and Average Manager, MBA--actors who are removed from the major emissions by several degrees [e.g., @Howard-Grenville2014; @Etzion2018]. These actors are *not able to acquiesce* and effectively tackle the challenges. *Nor can they defy and manipulate* institutional processes. We would have to turn to the source of pollution to find actors with an interest or even need for defiance and manipulation--actors who display the more extreme end of the spectrum that the title alludes to. The next section gathers deliberately pointed recent examples from the fossil fuel industry.

### Where should we look, what research can we build on?

These are deliberately crass examples to make the point for looking at the spectrum of responses to institutional pressure. The argument--for now--is not how prevalent these extreme responses are, but that they exist. @Oliver1991 represents a great starting point to find similar phenomena and empirical work that we could draw on. The following are some brief examples from the extant literature. There are two strands of research. 

\(1) Quantitative work on lobbying, and other work in the area of nonmarket strategy may potentially show how widespread activities on the manipulation end of the spectrum are [e.g., @Ridge2017; @Delmas2016; @Aranda2018]. But the existing quantitative work has revealed little in terms of processes and consequences of manipulative practices and the work is missing the necessary details to distinguish facets of the spectrum.

\(2) There are a few prominent ethnographic works. @Santos2009 features striking examples of manipulation. Companies claim markets by engaging in bad faith negotiations with competitors--*by lying*--to buy time, by acquiring potential competitors to protect their monopoly position, and by entering into alliances with the declared purpose of delaying large firms' market entries. The data is quite clear in that the research subjects themselves describe how they manipulate potential competitors. On the other hand, in terms of the empirical context studied it is rather far removed from the issue of grand challenges such as climate change. In the empirical context of @Santos2009 the success of the startup organizations depends on their ability to manipulate larger organizations. Given the power differences, this finding makes sense, but it also makes manipulation a virtue. In addition, a move from market competition arena to a climate change arena may change how the dynamics play out.

Some works by Elsbach are more adjacent to our phenomenon of interest, like her research on the environmental legitimacy of the Californian cattle industry, which features denial [@Elsbach1994], or her work hospital billing which covers intimidation and and bureaucracy as means of defiance [@Elsbach1998]. Her prior work on social movements on the other hand highlights that the corporations are not the only type of organizations that may engage in norm breaking behavior [@Elsbach1992]--a fair observation, but one that raises more questions about the nature of discourse and how to responding to environmental challenges.

<!-- > *Annotation*: This section takes @Oliver1991 as a starting point to identify potentially relevant research. It also picks up work on lobbying that has been procured from @Fleming2014. The idea is to look at work that is further removed and draw on that work to create a research agenda for the intersection that has been identified in the first paragraph/section. I am currently compiling my material into a table flesh out this section, see: <http://wiki.jbarg.net/Lobbying.md>.-->
