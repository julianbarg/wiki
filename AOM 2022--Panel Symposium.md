## Topic

**Lying to others, more so than lying to ourselves. Putting manipulation back onto the spectrum**

<!--The situation is dire.-->
Sustainability has gone mainstream [@Ergene2020]. The pressure for institutional change to combat climate change and tackle to other environmental grand challenges is now top of mind for many. How serious are we about this need for significant change? How have corporations responded to the call for action? Before looking at any data, one could imagine two general responses: compliance and resistance. @Oliver1991 offers a more differentiated taxology in her work on the more general phenomenon of strategic responses to institutional processes (See Figure 1). Actors can acquiesce, compromise, avoid, defy, or manipulate institutional processes, where e.g., defiance may involve attacking the source of institutional pressure. Oliver's theoretical work provides a very decent taxology--what did the empirical strain of research find?

![Figure 1: Olicer (1991) Table 2](/uploads/Oliver_Table_2.png){width=600px}

There are different strands of empirical research that could talk to the question at hand, the three most fitting of which we shall cover briefly. All three of them have mostly landed in the middle of the road on Oliver's spectrum. (1) The decoupling literature touches on companies "faking it" but focuses mostly on those with good intentions who "muddle through" [@Crilly2012; @Bromley2012]. (2) The greenwashing literature calls out gaps between reporting and reality, but more than on manipulation and misinformation it focuses on the many reasons for discrepancies that are out of a company's control [@Lyon2015]. 

(3) Finally, the management literature more widely has turned to climate change. Climate change is a relatively centralized phenomenon, with the top 50 fossil fuel companies accounting for roughly 50% of global emissions [@Griffin2017]. The focus of research however is more on EverydayCorp and Average Manager, MBA--actors who are removed from the major emissions by several degrees [e.g., @Howard-Grenville2014; @Etzion2018]. These actors are *not in a position to acquiesce* and effectively tackle the challenges *or to defy and manipulate* institutional processes--we would have to turn to the source of pollution to find actors with an interest or even need for defiance and manipulation. The next paragraph represents a--deliberately pointed--recent examples from the industry.<!--

> *Annotation*: This paragraph should touch on [@Oliver1991] which provides us with the spectrum of possible responses to institutional processes. The way in is to look at current work on sustainability and how this body of literature summarizes the responses by companies to the institutional pressure on climate action. The way in is also a reaction I had to an AOM ONE online event with Andy Hoffman and Bobby Banerjee. The main point of discussion was the prevalence or relevance of firms which fight "tooth and nail" against demands for institutional change. At practitioner conferences for instance they will be absent. There are two ways to approach this phenomenon of them beeing--seemingly?--small in numbers. The first one is to emphasize: the impact of firms which defy and manipulate can belie their small *numbers*--they are large in *revenue*. On conferences they would not be found because keeping a low profile is part of the strategy (see Table 1). The second would be to emphasize: the response to institutional pressure is on a continuous scale (from acquiescence to avoidance and manipulation), and one would err on the side of naivity by not actively and continuously considering the right side of the spectrum in analytical and empirical work.

Manipulation:<br/> scientific discourse | Did we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science? Absolutely not. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that is true. But there is nothing illegal about that. You know, we were looking out for our investments. You know, we were looking out for our shareholders.
Manipulation:<br/> public discourse     | Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans. And the cynical side of me says 'yeah, we kind of know that.' But it gives us a talking point that we can say: 'well, what is ExxonMobil for?'--'well, we're for a carbon tax.'
Manipulation:<br/> regulatory discourse | You want to be able to go to the chief. And so the chief knows you, and you can go to the chief and say 'look, we have got this issue, we need congressman so-and-so to be able to--to introduce this bill, we need him to make a floor statement, we need him to send the letter.'
Avoidance:<br/> regulatory discourse    | We do not want it to be us to have these conversations, especially in a hearing. It is getting our associations to step in, and have those conversations, and answer those tough questions. And be the--for the lack of a better term--the whipping boy for some of these members of congress.

* *Note*. Excerpts from a covert interview between Keith McCoy, Senior Director of Federal Relations at ExxonMobil and Lawrence Carter of Unearthed who poses as a recruiter [@Carter2021; @Carter2021a; @Thomson2021]. Unearthed is an investigative journalism project by Greenpeace UK. Full transcriped interview at <http://wiki.jbarg.net/ExxonMobil%20lobbyist%20interviews.md>.

In June 2021, a Greenpeace-affiliated journalist poses as a recruiter on Zoom and interviews two high-profile ExxonMobil lobbyists (see Table 1). The interviews provides a rare inside perspective on malicious PR practices. The financing of shadow groups to support questionable research. The poisoning of public discourse through bad faith statements. And the influencing of public officials to a degree that would make a cynic blush. The interview data follows a slew of other revelations on the climate denial scene [@Farrell2016]. Also on ExxonMobil, journalists and researchers conducted archival research and interviews with former employees. Their inquiries show that that Exxon in the 70s and 80s, prior to the merger with Mobil, understood climate change well before opposing climate action in the 90s [@Banerjee2015; @Supran2017; @Supran2020]. A comparable study has been conducted on Total, with similar findings [@Bonneuil2021]. Finally, there is the curious case a prominent climate denialist who switched teams and in the process spilled the beans on the practices of the Cato institute, a libertarian think tank cofounded by Charles Koch [@Gunther2017].

How can we either safely use it or eliminate it. There is not the debate right now about who manufactures it, thankfully.-->

> *Annotation*: These are deliberately crass examples to make the point for looking at the spectrum of responses to institutional pressure. The argument--for now--is not how prevalent these extreme responses are, but that they exist. Ideally, the examples should also show that the phenomenon is relevant and worthy of our research attention.

### Where should we look, what research can we build on?

Let's return to the spectrum of strategic responses to institutional pressure laid out by @Oliver1991. There are two strands of research. There are a few prominent ethnographic works. [@Santos2009] features examples of manipulation. Companies claim markets by engaging in bad faith negotiations with competitors to buy time, by acquiring potential competitors to protect their monopoly position, and by entering into alliances with the declared purpose of delaying large firms' market entries. The data is quite clear in that the research subjcts themselves describe how they manipulate potential competitors. On the other hand, in terms of the empirical context studied it is rater far removed from the issue of grand challenges such as climate change. Some works by Elsbach are more adjacent to our phenomenon of interest, like her research on the environmental legitimacy of the Californian cattle industry, which features denial [@Elsbach1994], or her work hospital billing which covers intimidation and and bureacracy as means of defiance [@Elsbach1998]. Quantitative work on lobbying, and other work in the area of nonmarket strategy may potentially show how widespread activities on the manipulation end of the spectrum are. But the existing quantitative work has revealed little in terms of processes and consequences of manipulative practices [e.g., @Ridge2017; @Delmas2016; @Aranda2018].

> *Annotation*: This section takes @Oliver1991 as a starting point to identify potentially relevant research. It also picks up work on lobbying that has been procured from @Fleming2014. The idea is to look at work that is further removed and draw on that work to create a research agenda for the intersection that has been identified in the first paragraph/section. I am currently compiling my material into a table flesh out this section, see: <http://wiki.jbarg.net/Lobbying.md>.
