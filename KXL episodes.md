### Narrative

When the debate on KXL first came up, Nebraska--unlike Montana and South Dakota--[[did not have in place a formal process for deciding on pipeline routes|https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/17265215/state-department-delays-keystone-xl-decision-until-2013]]. Under state regulations, KXL did not originally require an environmental impact statement for Nebraska. Assessment of environmental impacts in Nebraska were hence carried out at the federal level by the State Department. Pipeline operators could build, and--as far as I understand--use eminent domain to acquire right-of-way as they like in Nebraska, since pipelines are considered public infrastructure. As far as I understand, for the use of eminent domain, an 80% share of the total route has to have been acuiqed. The State Department was involved because KXL crosses the Canada-US border. 

The absense of regulation was a problem for Nebraska. Unlike its "older brother" Keystone, KXL was planned run through the [[Sandhills]]. Nebraska would have no say in the approval process for the pipeline through this sensitive region. [[The State Department eventually decided in November 2011 to delay the decision on the pipeline until 2013 in order to carry out a study on alternative routes.|https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/government/article/17265215/state-department-delays-keystone-xl-decision-until-2013]] The legislature and governor of Nebraska were opposed to the route through the sandhills, [[but unlike the environmentalist movement, they were not opposed to the construction of a pipeline through the state or the oil industry in general|https://journalstar.com/news/local/heineman-wants-president-to-deny-pipeline-permit/article_49eeb3fd-b4f1-5e79-99ae-aea09c7757ab.html]]. Because of the 


A As a temporary solution, the legislature of Nebraska called a special session to decide on an [[alternative route|KXL reroute]] for KXL. TransCanada accepted this alternative route in December of 2011--TransCanada had previously stated that any alternative route around Sandhills would be too costly.

The codification of the alternative law was 

To rectify the more general problem--the absense of a formal process--Nebraska introduced law [[LB 1611]] in April of 2012. The majority of Nebraska's unicameral legislature, [[and the governor were critical of the route through the Sandhills, . KXL's new route had already been given the green light by the special session, but LB1611 would apply to future pipelines projects. LB1611 provides a swift process: 

no interest to prevent, just to reroute. push it into next legislature
