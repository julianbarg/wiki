### Narrative

Three scenes. August 2011. Environmental movements in Nebraska and Governor Heineman form an uneasy alliance against TransCanada and the State Department. Their common goal: to protect the Sandhills and reroute KXL. November 15, 2011. In Nebraska, the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act takes shape. A representative of TransCanada and a representative of the Sierra Club attent the Natural Resource Committee of the Nebraska Legislature and celebrate the progress of the bill. Robert Jones (TransCanada): "We appreciate [...] this legislation which would create a process for an additional review of the proposed Keystone pipeline route through Nebraska, and we encourage approval of the bill as amended [by AM37]." Ken Winston (Sierra Club): "We ask the advancement of AM37 to LB4" [@NRC2011]. September 5, 2014. Oral arguments are being heard before the Nebraska Supreme Court. For two years, environmental groups on one side and Nebraska supported by TransCanada on the other side have been fighting a legal battle over LB1161, which set forth that LB4 would also apply to a resubmitted application for KXL.

When TransCanada began the permit application process for KXL, Nebraska--unlike Montana and South Dakota--did not have in place a formal process for deciding on pipeline routes. Under Nebraska state regulations, KXL did not originally require an environmental impact statement for Nebraska. Assessment of environmental impacts in Nebraska were hence carried out at the federal level by the State Department. Pipeline operators could build, and use eminent domain to acquire right-of-way as they like in Nebraska, since pipelines are considered public infrastructure under Nebraska law. As far as I understand, for the use of eminent domain, an 80% share of the total route has to have been acuiqed. The State Department was involved because KXL crosses the Canada-US border. 

As KXL turned more controversial, the absense of regulation became a problem for Nebraska. Unlike its "older brother" Keystone, KXL was planned run through the [[Sandhills]]. Nebraska would have no say in the approval process for the pipeline through this sensitive region. The State Department eventually decided in November 2011 to delay the decision on the pipeline until 2013 in order to carry out a study on alternative routes. The legislature and governor of Nebraska were opposed to the route through the sandhills, but unlike the environmentalist movement, they were not opposed to the construction of a pipeline through the state or the oil industry in general. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, released on August 26, 2011, emphasizes state rights with regard to setting the pipeline route. The State Department emphasized this point repeatedly when communicating with Nebraska through multiple channels.

As a first reaction, the Governor of Nebraska wrote a letter to the State Department on August 31. The letter called for the pipeline to be rerouted around the Sandhills, but also expressed support for a pipeline through Nebraska. For some time there were rumors that Nebraska's unicameral Legislature would call a special session to exercise its right to determine the pipeline route. Eventually, on October 24, Governor Heineman called a special session, to sit for two weeks starting November 1. The legislature of Nebraska passed two laws in its special session. The first law, LB1, laid out a more thorough process that would apply to future pipelines of the likes of KXL through Nebraska. Under LB1, an application would be subject to a review by the Public Service Commission that could last up to 19 months. The second law, LB4, was tailored to allow Department of Environmental Quality under the guidance of the governor to contract an outside firm for an environmental impact statement on KXL--with the usual tender process being waived. Compared to LB1, LB4 would offer a more streamlined process.

While the special session was sitting, the State Department announced that it would carry out a supplemental environmental impact statement, delaying the decision on KXL until at least 2013. The oil and gas industry, spearheaded by the API, saw this decision as an attempt by the State Department to stall the approval process for KXL in order to charm environmentalists: "This is about politics and keeping a radical constituency opposed to any and all oil and gas development in the president's camp in November 2012" [@Tippee2011]. In contrast, a representative of TransCanada found words of praise for the plans of the Nebraska Legislature, during a meeting of the legislature's Environmental Resource Commission: "We are pleased that AM37 calls for the work to be done in an effective and timely manner" [@NRC2011].

Two months later, in December of 2011, the House of Representatives came to see the 2012 federal funding as an opportunity to force a swift approval of KXL. The House forced a passage of the payroll tax bill which included a rider that would force the completion of the KXL national interest determination within 60 days. The President signed this bill into law on December 2011. Less than a month later, on January 18, 2012 the DOS issued a negative national interest determination for KXL, stating that 60 days are "insufficient for a determination" [@DOS2012]. However, the statement issued also specified that the denial woudl "not preclude any subsequent permit application or applications for similar projects" [@DOS2012].

Three months later, in April 2012, the legislature of Nebraska passed a bill, LB1161, that would render this future permit application for KXL easier. The bill set forth that for any future application, a pipeline operator could choose to go through the relative simple process originally intended for the supplemental environmental impact assessment of KXL as set forth in LB4, rather than having to undergo the relatively lengthy process for permit applications as intended under LB1. Less than a month later, TransCanada decided to take advantage of this opportunity and resubmitted its application under LB1161/LB4. Later that month, three landowners filed suit against LB1161.

What followed was a lengthy legal battle over LB1161 that pitted the landowners and environmental groups against the state of Nebraska and TransCanada. The State Department began working on a new environmental impact statement, but deferred these efforts in April 2014, after the opponents had attained a number of legal victories. In its press statement, the State Department blamed the delay on the "uncertainty created by the on-going litigation in the Nebraska Supreme Court which could ultimately affect the pipeline route in that state" [@DOS2014a]. Over a year later, in September 2015, TransCanada withdrew from the lawsuit and agreed to submit its decision under LB1 rather than under LB1161/LB4.

The three-year delay caused by the friendly legislation in Nebraska meant that TransCanada would also have to resubmit its permit application South Dakota--its 2010 permit had expired after five years, in February 2015. The snowballing problems delayed a decision by the State Department on KXL until late 2015, when the outgoing US president, free from pressure from voters and supporters, decided to reject the permit application. 

#### Interpretation

The Nebraska episode may be an extreme outlier in how much it has derailed the environmental impact assessment for KXL, but episode is also representative of a more general phenomenon. In 2011, multiple stakeholders gathered under a vaguely environmental banner and intervened. The Governor called a special session of the Nebraska Legislature to pass bills on the issue. The momentum was toward a route that would avoid the Sandhills. Toward that end, the legislature passed a bill and provided funds for an environmental impact assessment of an alternative route. Despite its more general rejection of pipelines, the Sierra Club welcomed the decision, and the opportunity to engage in an environmental impact assessment at the state, rather than the federal level--after all, the outcome of the State Department's asssessment had been disappointing for environmental groups. TransCanada viewed the decision of the legislature not as a threat to the project, but as an opportunity to realize an alternative route for KXL in a swift fashion--the legislature's intention was to hire a contractor to conduct an environmental impact assessment as soon as possible, and under the guidance of Governor Heineman, who was generally in favor of KXL. _And Nebraska would even pay for the assessment!_

The initial win-win-win situation quickly fell apart when three interactions occured. The House of Representatives tried to speed up the process, thereby inadvertantly killing the application. Governor Heineman thought he was being smart when he orchestrated for the legislature to pass an additional law that would allow for the smooth environmental impact assessment process to also apply to a new KXL permit application. And when TransCanada resubmitted its permit appliation, the whole application process was stalled by the legal battle that ensued over the new bill.

The unexpected interaction also completely derailed the discourse on the environmental impacts of Keystone XL. While in 2011, the potential impacts on Nebraska's Sandhills dominated the debate, by 2013 the legal battle dominated the news. To understand the debate at this point one would have to go to the Nebraska constitution, and the circumstances under which LB1, LB4, and LB1161 were passed. Specific enironmental concerns, such as the Sandhills, are only of marginal importance at this point in time. The conflict on KXL has taken on new, none-environmental dimensions, which has led to an entranchement of the two sides. In 2011, a shared concern for the Sandhills was sufficient to bring together the Sierra Club and the Natural Resoruce Committee of the Nebraska Legislature. The focus on the Sandhills even allowed for a representative of TransCanada to join at the table. By 2013, the two sides would have to push throught the issue of the botched law reform that is LB1161 to even get to talk about specific environmental issues. At the same time, the lawsuit had become a tool for the environmental movement to forestall KXL or even threaten the project as a whole, and had superseeded specific environmental concerns. It allowed the movement to fight KXL for environmental reasons without having to develop the environmental arguments.
