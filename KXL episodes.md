# Keystone XL--Idiosyncratic Episodes

## Nebraska law episodes

When the debate on KXL first came up, Nebraska did not have in place any project they like and--as far as I understand--use eminent domain to acquire right-of-way, since it is considered public infrastructure. For the use of eminent domain, a certain threshold in percent of the total route has to have been acuiqed--as far as I understand. For KXL, that was a problem, since unlike its bigger brother Keystone, it would run through the [[Sandhills]]. Hence, Nebraska would have no say in the approval process, for the pipeline through this region. To rectify this problem, Nebraska introduced law LB1611--but only after TransCanada had already agreed to change their route. The majority party of Nebraska's unicameral legislature--Republicans--were critical of the route through the Sandhills, but unlike the environmentalist movement, they are not opposed to pipelines, or the oil industry in general. TransCanada's position used to be that an alternative route would be to expensive. When the DOS announced in December 2011 that the environmental impact assessment would be delayed for an additional anaylsis of the impact on the Sandhills, TransCanada gave in and agreed to an [[alternative route|KXL reroute]] that would avoid the Sandhills.
