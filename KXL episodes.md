### Narrative

Three scenes. August 2011. Environmental movements in Nebraska and Governor Heineman form an uneasy alliance against TransCanada and the State Department. Their common goal: to protect the Sandhills and reroute KXL. November 15, 2011. In Nebraska, the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act takes shape. A representative of TransCanada and a representative of the Sierra Club attent the Natural Resource Committee of the Nebraska legislature and celebrate the progress of the bill. Robert Jones (TransCanada): "We appreciate [...] this legislation which would create a process for an additional review of the proposed Keystone pipeline route through Nebraska, and we encourage approval of the bill as amended [by AM37]." Ken Winston (Sierra Club): "We ask the advancement of AM37 to LB4" [@NRC2011]. September 5, 2014. Oral arguments are being heard before the Nebraska Supreme Court. For two years, environmental movements and the government of Nebraska have fought a legal battle over LB1161, which set forth that LB4 would also apply to a resubmitted application for KXL.

When TransCanada began the permit application process for KXL, Nebraska--unlike Montana and South Dakota--did not have in place a formal process for deciding on pipeline routes. Under Nebraska state regulations, KXL did not originally require an environmental impact statement for Nebraska. Assessment of environmental impacts in Nebraska were hence carried out at the federal level by the State Department. Pipeline operators could build, and use eminent domain to acquire right-of-way as they like in Nebraska, since pipelines are considered public infrastructure under Nebraska law. As far as I understand, for the use of eminent domain, an 80% share of the total route has to have been acuiqed. The State Department was involved because KXL crosses the Canada-US border. 

As KXL turned more controversial, the absense of regulation became a problem for Nebraska. Unlike its "older brother" Keystone, KXL was planned run through the [[Sandhills]]. Nebraska would have no say in the approval process for the pipeline through this sensitive region. The State Department eventually decided in November 2011 to delay the decision on the pipeline until 2013 in order to carry out a study on alternative routes. The legislature and governor of Nebraska were opposed to the route through the sandhills, but unlike the environmentalist movement, they were not opposed to the construction of a pipeline through the state or the oil industry in general. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, released on August 26, 2011, emphasizes state rights with regard to setting the pipeline route. The State Department emphasized this point repeatedly when communicating with Nebraska through multiple channels.

As a first reaction, the Governor of Nebraska wrote a letter to the State Department on August 31, calling for the pipeline to be rerouted, but expressing support for the pipeline. For some time there were rumors that the Nebraska unicameral legislature would call a special session to exercise its right to determine the pipeline route. Eventually, on October 24, Governor Heineman called a special session, to sit for two weeks starting November 1. The legislature of Nebraska passed two laws in its special session. The first law, LB1, laid out a more thorough process that would apply to future pipelines of the likes of KXL through Nebraska. Under LB1, an application would be subject to a review by the Public Service Commission that could last up to 19 months. The second law, LB4, was tailored to allow Department of Environmental Quality under the guidance of the governor to contract an outside firm for an environmental impact statement on KXL--with the usual tender process being waived. Compared to LB1, LB4 would offer a more streamlined process.

While the special session was sitting, the State Department announced that State Department would carry out a supplemental environmental impact statement, delaying the decision on KXL until at least 2013. The oil and gas industry, spearheaded by the API, saw this decision as an attempt by the State Department to stall the approval process for KXL in order to charm environmentalists: "This is about politics and keeping a radical constituency opposed to any and all oil and gas development in the president's camp in November 2012" [@Tippee2011]. In contrast, a representative of TransCanada found words of praise for the plans of the Nebraska legislature, during a meeting of the legislatures Environmental Resource Commission: "We are pleased that AM37 calls for the work to be done in an effective and timely manner" [@NRC2011].



Because of the delay, TransCanada would also have to renew its permit for South Dakota, which is only good for five years.
