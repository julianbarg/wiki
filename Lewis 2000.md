### Concepts

#### From framework (see Figure 1 below)
* Tensions: "Cognitively and/or socially constructed polarities that obscure the interrelatedness of the contradictions" ("self-referential loops, mixed-messages, system contradictions")
* Reinforcing cycles: "Paralyzing defenses, which initially reduce discomfort and anxiety, yet eventually intensify tensions" ("splitting, projection, repression, regression, reaction formation, ambivalence")
* Management: "Attempts to explore tensions and thereby tap the potential energy, insights, and power of paradox that enables dramatic change" ("acceptance, confrontation, transcendence")

#### From grouping of literature
* Paradoxes of Learning: "Learning requires using, critiquing, and often destroying past understandings and practices to construct new and more complicated frames of reference"
* Paradoxes of Organizing: "Organizing denotes an ongoing process of equilibrating opposing forces that encourage commitment, trust, and creativity while maintaining efficiency, discipline, and order."
* Paradoxes of Belonging: "Groups become cohesive, influential, and distinctive by valuing the diversity of their members and their interconnections with other groups."

## One-paragraph summary
In this early review, Lewis (2000) conceptualizes paradox as perceptual: socially or cognitively constructed. Paradoxes are defined as "contradictory yet interwoven elements" (Lewis 2000: 761). The article sets forth a framework of paradox in action: (1) paradoxes are constructed, (2) they can fuel reinforcing (vicious) cycles, and (3) one can manage (accept, confront, or transcendent) a paradox, with varying benefits. The rest of the article consists of a review of the literature, and advice on how to incorporate paradox in future research.
