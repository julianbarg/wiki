## One-paragraph question

Impacts of pipeline spills are assumed to be more immediate--death of fishes, birds, etc. Oil degrading bacteria exist in many ecosystems, feeding on naturally occurring hydrocarbons (Atlas & Hazen 2011). In saltwater, coastal marine environment, dispersion is assumed to be a good thing, whereas in a river environment it is undesirable--because oil from the river bed tends to resurface from turbulences. Overall, a whole lot of questions, and the observation that "it depends" whether the formation of OPAs is a good thing.
