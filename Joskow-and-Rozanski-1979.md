## One-paragraph summary

Joskow and Rozanski (1979) study the learning curve for operating nuclear plants. From the offset, improving reliability in the sector might seem like improving the provision of a service. Reliability in this case however describes the *capacity factor* of nuclear plants: its annual energy production divided by its theoretical maximum output if it ran constantly at full loud for the whole year. E.g., if a nuclear plant ran at full loud for half a year, and then was shut off for maintenance for the other six month, its capacity factor would be 0.5. Thus, the article resembles more closely a performance story than one might initially think.

They propose a great lot of mechanisms that could allow operators to improve the reliability of nuclear plants.

* "reduced labor requirements as tasks become routinized through repetition" (ibid., 161). The authors most definitely refer to individual learning, but this phenomenon could apply to higher order learning as well.
* "the effects of learning by management leading to more efficient production and labor scheduling and improved production control" (ibid., 161)
* "learning by the engineering department of a firm" (ibid., 161)
1. "redesigns [of] the capital equipment utilized by workers" (ibid., 161)
2. "changes in the operation of the plant to improve routing and handling of the material" (ibid., 161)
* "the effect of increased efficiency of suppliers" (could in my studies be controlled for through technology)


With regard to learning (of the operating staff) they note:

"A survey made in 1972 indicated that plant equipment failures were responsible for 96% of all forced outages (during a forced outage, a plant is completely shut down). Only 4% were directly attributable to operator errors." (ibid., 162).
