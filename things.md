* An "organization's internal representation of the world" ([[Madsen and Desai 2010]], 452) still matters, even if it is not shared by all members; most members will still be aware of it, even if they do not agree with some of the "statutes" of what constitutes reality. A strong example: a member recognizes that the organization thinks of itself as doing activity A excellently. But this member believes, management actually performs poorly on work that is related to activity A, and her or his units work merely manages to make up for these flaws, and thus the organization performs fine.
