1. Regarding the choice of journal. Org Science's page limit is 45 pages for qualitative research at 11-point, while AMJ is 40 pages at 12-point, however AMJ "recognize[s] that papers [...] that require additional space for data presentation or reference [...] may require more than 40 pages". If I really want to go the path of including some qualitative data with my quantitative work, there are no antecedents in Org Sci. In AMJ there are to notable mixed methods papers: [[Vergne 2012]] and [[Sonenshein, DeCelles & Dutton 2014]].
