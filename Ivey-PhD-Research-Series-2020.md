## Organizational learning and the natural environment

* Organizations can learn. They get better at the activities they undertake.

**->** Shouldn't that mean that we would also be getting better at protecting the natural environment?

* Learning can take multiple shapes though. If organizations to not recognize fails, the learning might be limited to learning of mitigation of the fallout.

### How do environmental impacts play out?

# Let's start over

1. Companies have environmental impacts.

2. Why don't they eliminate their environmental impacts?

3. What would be their motivations to do so?

    a. This point probably deserves most explanation.

4. Environmental feedback?

    a. Serious accidents (fail events/literature applies)

    b. Minor failure (near-misses - high chance that learning opportunity is missed)

5. Vicarious learning?

6. Population-level Learning?

7. What has learning concentrated on? Qualitative dimension of learning

    a. Learning could concentrate on mitigation rather than avoidance

    b. We have strong indications of this, for instance in the debate about dispersants

8. Then why isn't the performance all over the place/completely abhorrent?

    a. Metrics still apply. While there may not be a motivation for companies to improve performance on the metric, there is also no environmental feedback that would lead them to believe that they could get away with doing worse.

    b. Historical aspiration levels. Organizations in a population are selected for traits that increase chance of survival, one such being aspirations for improvement (is there a reason why this would also for goals that are not essential for survival?). For instance, there are cases of organizations' safety aspirations slipping, and companies going out of business because of lawsuits.

9. Is there any relevance from this for our original motivation in protecting the environment?
