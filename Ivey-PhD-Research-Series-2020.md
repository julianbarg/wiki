## Organizational learning and the natural environment

* Organizations can learn. They get better at the activities they undertake.

**->** Shouldn't that mean that we would also be getting better at protecting the natural environment?

* Learning can take multiple shapes though. If organizations to not recognize fails, the learning might be limited to learning of mitigation of the fallout.

### How do environmental impacts play out?

# Let's start over

1. Companies have environmental impacts.

2. Why don't they eliminate their environmental impacts?

3. What are the motivations to do so?

    a. This point probably deserves most explanation.

4. Environmental feedback?

    a. Serious accidents (fail events/literature applies)

    b. Minor failure (near-misses - high chance that learning opportunity is missed)

5. Vicarious learning?

6. Population-level Learning?

7. What has learning concentrated on? Qualitative dimension of learning

    a. Learning could concentrate on mitigation rather than avoidance

    b. We have strong indications of this, for instance in the debate about dispersants
