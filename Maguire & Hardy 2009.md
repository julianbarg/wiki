# @Maguire2009

## One-paragraph summary

Researching desinstitutionalizatin. For that purpose drawing on "translation metaphor", and organizational discourse theory. Power/knowledge conceptualization is used to justifice the relevance of discourse. Some unclear distinction between regulative, normative, and cognitive elements is used to describe institutional processes. It is difficult for outsiders to make changes to institutions from the outside (although I would argue that it isn't so--outsiders have the freedom to imagine a different future). @Maguire2009 argue both that discourses are structured and coherent, yet that they are also dominated by Foucaultian power/knowledge--there is a tension there. Further, they pick up the the actor-network theory, that meaning emerges when text "translated" by a reader (not before that).

In summary, @Maguire2009 make a dual claim--that we can both read a discourse to understand what is going on, and that really we need to look at actors translation of text to see what is going on. 

## Notes

* Outside deinstitutionalization is hoped to help with the radical change needed with regard to climate change (p. 148).
* Introducing "defensive institutional work" (p. 149).
