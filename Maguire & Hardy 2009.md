# @Maguire2009

## One-paragraph summary

Researching desinstitutionalizatin. For that purpose drawing on "translation metaphor", and organizational discourse theory. Power/knowledge conceptualization is used to justifice the relevance of discourse. Some unclear distinction between regulative, normative, and cognitive elements is used to describe institutional processes. It is difficult for outsiders to make changes to institutions from the outside (although I would argue that it isn't so--outsiders have the freedom to imagine a different future). @Maguire2009 argue both that discourses are structured and coherent, yet that they are also dominated by Foucaultian power/knowledge--there is a tension there. Further, they pick up the the actor-network theory, that meaning emerges when text "translated" by a reader (not before that). In a discourse, we observe a "chain" of subsequent translations.

In summary, @Maguire2009 make a dual claim--that we can both read a discourse to understand what is going on, and that really we need to look at actors translation of text to see what is going on.

In the paper, Rachel Carson (author of the book _Silent Spring_ which triggered a debate on DDT) is described as an outsider to the discourse on DDT, and the paper addressed the question of how outsiders can push for deinstitutionalization. But is she really an outsider? She has a science background, aspired to do a PhD, and certainly had learned a thing or two on chemistry during her studies of biology. She would be in command of the language of science, regarless of the fact that she chose the medium of a book that addresses the general public. Maybe @Maguire2009 applied a more narrow definition of institutional discourse than I would have chosen intuitively.

Toward the end, @Maguire2009 introduce the concept of defensive institutional work.

## Notes

* Outside deinstitutionalization is hoped to help with the radical change needed with regard to climate change (p. 148).
* Introducing "defensive institutional work" (p. 149).
