## Critical summary

Researching desinstitutionalizatin. For that purpose drawing on "translation metaphor", and organizational discourse theory. Power/knowledge conceptualization is used to justifice the relevance of discourse. Some unclear distinction between regulative, normative, and cognitive elements is used to describe institutional processes. It is difficult for outsiders to make changes to institutions from the outside (although I would argue that it isn't so--outsiders have the freedom to imagine a different future). @Maguire2009 argue both that discourses are structured and coherent, yet that they are also dominated by Foucaultian power/knowledge--there is a tension there. Further, they pick up the the actor-network theory, that meaning emerges when text "translated" by a reader (not before that). In a discourse, we observe a "chain" of subsequent translations.

In summary, @Maguire2009 make a dual claim--that we can both read a discourse to understand what is going on, and that really we need to look at actors translation of text to see what is going on.

In the paper, Rachel Carson (author of the book _Silent Spring_ which triggered a debate on DDT) is described as an outsider to the discourse on DDT, and the paper addressed the question of how outsiders can push for deinstitutionalization. But is she really an outsider? She has a science background, aspired to do a PhD, and certainly had learned a thing or two on chemistry during her studies of biology. She would be in command of the language of science, regarless of the fact that she chose the medium of a book that addresses the general public. Maybe @Maguire2009 applied a more narrow definition of institutional discourse than I would have chosen intuitively.

The overall flow of the narrative: in 1962, everything is good--structured and coherent--in the world of DDT. Rachel Carson introduces a new problematization of DDT, and over time this new position has become normalized. However, as her position is translated by institional insiders, it has taken on a slightly changed form--or in the language of the authors it has been "subverted". There is no more call for biological pest controll, instead other chemicals replace DDT.

In the discussion section, @Maguire2009 introduce the concept of defensive institutional work.

The conclusion brings up some interesting facts. There is still some support for DDT--as a form of malaria control. An interesting indicator with regards to modelling--choice of action based on pre-existing goals and preferences. The discourse of DDT cannot be resolved by either deciding on a primacy of nature or human health--both are indefensible subject positions. Only a study of the specific context--considering the environmental impacts of e.g., widely spraying DDT on cotton or spraying the inside of houses for malaria control--can accomplish that purpose. And the "progress" we currently experience based supposedly on greater maximes such as Rachel Carson's (justified) apocalyptical vision should not be taken for granted where there is still the potential for new, "more important" concerns to emerge and put into question past decisions. Only an understanding of history and context can--but such understanding cannot be assumed to be stable.

## Notes

* Outside deinstitutionalization is hoped to help with the radical change needed with regard to climate change (p. 148).
* Introducing "defensive institutional work" (p. 149).
