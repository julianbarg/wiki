### Takeaways
* "[L]earning by doing [...] creates knowledge that prompts improvements or progress. Progress functions express this principle by connecting progress directly with experience and by using proxies for measuring each of these two factors: cost improvements for measuring progress and cumulative output for measuring production."

## One-paragraph summary
Dutton, Thomas and Butler (1984) explore the development of the learning curve up to their study. They find a literature that is split between different areas (engineering, management, economics and accounting). A lot of the research on progress functions (to that point) had been undertaken by engineers. The authors even explore the possibility that learning curve is self-fulfilling strategy. The literature had also moved from "direct-labor learning to "factors such as improved plant and equipment, other adaptive efforts, and cognitive learning by direct and indirect labor as well as technical personnel."(ibid. 218). It also offers evidence of learning curve literature moving from production to other areas, such as safety (ibid. 216 f.). Similarly, the research moved from finding the learning curve "systematic and stable" to "patterns [... that vary] widely for similar processes and products and even for subsequent runs of the same product in the same plant" (ibid. 220). This can be understood as a criticism of the learning curve (or its literature): many authors have treated the learning curve as very reliably, despite "the extreme and often unexplained variation in [... learning] patterns" (ibid. 217).

Finally, the article compares studies both articles that seek to isolate causal factors ("T" studies), and prescriptive studies ("A" studies). The existence of these disparate literatures are used to substantiate the authors claims that it is a  disconnect between practitioners and academics that allowed the "myth" of a reliable learning curve to proliferate. The article makes an important contribution: it guided researchers toward factors apart from direct-labor learning that contribute to organizational learning.

## Questions/Criticism/Extension
* Would it be possible, for instance, that organizations, once they reach a certain level from which progress is difficult to achieve, lower their standards to achieve this progress on the learning curve?

* The authors propagate that we see continuous improvements in productivity, which (partially) explains our economic growth. Is there a limit to *this kind* of economic "growth"? We are increasingly improving meta-routines. For instance management software such as SAP, software that allows for quick iterating in product development such as CAD, or efficient supply chain, and last but not least robots for production. Thus, learning has reached a new quality. Is there a ceiling?
