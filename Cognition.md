## One-paragraph summary
Managers are not simply facilitators of organizational change that would occur regardless. Instead of a "rationalist" view (which would assume that managers simply do what is "best for the company"), the cognition literature tracks the impact of managerial attention on firm decisions. Porac, Thomas and Baden-Fuller (1989) for instance described rudimentary how managers' mental models are linked to those of customers, suppliers, and competitors. In the 2000s, efforts were made to formalize this stream of literature through empirical research. Eggers and Kaplan (2009) for instance provide evidence that managerial attention matters, even beyond or in addition to the effects of organizational efforts in the area. They also show that managerial attention toward an area can enhance the effect of organizational attention toward the same area (interaction effect). Vergne and Depeyre (2016) combine the research on cognition with research on dynamic capabilities. They find, too, that cognition matters, independently from firm attributes (specifically, dynamic capabilities). Their results suggest that neither superior cognition nor dynamic capabilities *have to* be present - one being present is sufficient for a firm to make headway toward adaption.
