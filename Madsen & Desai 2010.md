## Reading takeaways
* There is a literature on knolwedge* that currently makes waves (ibid., 452).
* A questioning of what constitutes organizational knowledge is taking place; e.g., individual members' knowledge is taking a higher priority in the new understanding, and a dynamic view is promoted (ibid., 452 f.).
* *Definition*: organizational learning is "any modification of an organization's knowledge occurring as a result of its experience" (ibid., 453).
* *Operational definition*: organizational learning is "a modification in organizational performance as a result of experience (ibid., 453).
* Recent literature focuses more on failure (ibid., 453).
* Success inhibits nonlocal search - the current model of the world is seen as sufficient (ibid., 453).
* Failure is better for learning.
* Observing others' failures also helps.
* Success is more likely to lead to uncodified knowledge. Why? Because the success only reinforces existing knowledge.
* Major failure is better for learning than minor failure.
* Success hinders learning from others: e.g., the company may (wrongly) assume that it can cost on areas that avoid failure.
* In particular, organizations without many failures may lack differentiated knowledge to learn from others success experience.
* Finally, projection bias for inexperienced organizations, but organizations with failure experience have the cognitive map (of their area) that allows them to obtain differentiated knowledge from others failure. Specifically, they can figure out when others failure does not apply to them (H. 8, p. 458).

## One-page summary
(By Mayur Joshi)

The paper theorizes and empirically estimates the effect of failure and success on organizational learning. The core argument is that the extant literature has posited impact of organizational past experience on learning, however does not distinguish between the experience with success and experience with failure. This paper adds to that literature by disentangling impact of success and failure on organizational learning. The authors argue that three key conditions must be met before prior organizational experience can be expected to influence observed organizational performance: prior experience must motivate organization members to alter organizational knowledge; organization members must be able to extract meaningful new knowledge from experience; and the changes made to organizational knowledge must alter the subsequent behavior of organization members. The authors present arguments for *failure contributing more to learning than success*:

1. Behavioral theory of the firm: With prior success, the decision makers ignore information about outside world, makes them overconfident, directs attention to local information sources (local search).
2. Success leads to stability of organizational knowledge, failure challenges it. Failure triggers search of new models by discarding existing models. It triggers mindful reflection and induces problemistic search. 
3. Failure does not only imply the existance of gap, it also points to where that gap may be. Hence, it provides roadmap as to where the search activities may be most effective. 

Hence experience with failure is more likely than experience with success to induce motivation to alter knowledge, and ability to extract meaningful knowledge from experience.

H1. *Prior organizational failure experience reduces the likelihood of future organizational failure more than does prior organizational success experience.* (supported)

Further, the article posits importance of vicarious learning, i.e., learning from experience of others. The key arguments are:

1. Organizations within a domain possess similar knowledge base, hence impact of success v/s failure of others are likely to be similar to indigeneous success / failure.
2. Successful organizations tend to guard their knowledge, while the failures may make them more accessible, as they may willingly share the information, or may be forced to do so due to scrutiny. 

H2. *Observation of others' prior organizational failure experience reduces the likelihood of future organizational failure more than does observation of others' prior organizational success experience.* (partially supported)

Next, the article talks about knowledge depreciation due to sources viz., exit of organizational members, changes in organizational processes/ structure disrupting transactive memory / tacit knowledge / informal networks, and series of small changes in non codified routines over time. The tacit /non-codified knowledge depreciates faster than the codified knowledge. The authors argue that, the experience of failure, results into codification of the new learning, and hence leads to slow depreciation, compared to experience of success, which does not result into codification of new learning.
