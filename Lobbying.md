---                         | ------------
[[Aplin & Hegarty 1980]]    | There are different ways of making an impact on Congress--they are used to different degrees by different stakeholders.
[[Siegel 2007]]             | Government ties matter in a liberal (capitalist) system like they do in state capitalism. Ties cannot only be positive or neutral, but also a liability!
[[Santos & Eisenhardt 2009]]| The tricks that firms play to controll a market--e.g., acquire and dispose of potential competitors, negotiate in bad faith.
[[Delmas 2016]]             | Both firms with above and below average environmental performance engage in lobbying--with different goals!
[[Ridge et al 2017]]        | Lobbying success requires good ratio of depth (spending) and breadth, connectedness through well connected board members or employment of professional lobbyists.
