Article                     | Summary
---                         | ------------
[[Aplin & Hegarty 1980]]    | There are different ways of making an impact on Congress--they are used to different degrees by different stakeholders.<!--
[[Allen & Panian 1982]]     | If the CEO is a member of the owner family, he is less likely to be removed in times of poor firm performance.-->
[[D'Aveni & Kesner 1993]]   | Bidder and target membership in same social circles predicts tender offer success.
[[Siegel 2007]]             | Government ties matter in a liberal (capitalist) system like they do in state capitalism. Ties cannot only be positive or neutral, but also a liability!
[[Westphal & Bednar 2008]]  | CEOs employ interpersonal behavior with institutional investors toward ends such as increased compensation.
[[Santos & Eisenhardt 2009]]| The tricks that firms play to controll a market--e.g., acquire and dispose of potential competitors, negotiate in bad faith.
[[Delmas 2016]]             | Both firms with above and below average environmental performance engage in lobbying--with different goals!
[[Gond et al 2016]]         | The industry-government alliance on fracking in Québec and how it failed against civil society.
[[Ridge et al 2017]]        | Lobbying success requires good ratio of depth (spending) and breadth, connectedness through well connected board members or employment of professional lobbyists.
[[Aranda & Simons 2018]]    | Protests meet counterprotests by astroturfers, lobbying efforts. These affect institutional change.
