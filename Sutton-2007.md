## One-sentence summary
Established (at the time of this paper) theories of economic competition follow two firmly established logics. Chandlerian theory predicts that firms possess a long-term level of relative capabilities; a narrowing of the gap between competitors will be followed by a reverse movement, therefore, relative market positions persist over time. Schumpeter on the other hand predicts that a narrowing is the starting point of a persistent erosion of the leader’s position, thus market positions are relatively unstable and do not persist over time. 

Sutton (2007) proposes a simple random walk (Markovian) model to test the accuracy of one or the other proposal. Similar to Nelson & Winter (1982), he assumes a dynamic, nonlinear development for an industry, that nonetheless may exhibit medium term trends (a trend that may eventually be broken up by an evolutionary process in an industry, which Sutton does not explore).

To test whether industries’ behavior reflects the Chandlerian of Schumpeterian view, Sutton utilizes 22 years of observations from a Japanese database. He lets the first and second largest companies of 45 industries from this database “walk” according to the data of changes to market share in the respective industry. The simulation proceeds as follows: for each passing year, a change in market share is selected randomly from all observed (real-life data) observations of the specific industry in all years. The Monte Carlo method is used to generate a mean and 95% confidence interval. Then, the outcome is compared to the changes observed in reality. Specifically, the predicted number of swaps in industry leadership (second-largest company overtakes the previously largest company in terms of market share) across all industries, is compared to the overall number in the real data.

The numbers match up reasonably well so it seems that in most cases the premise of the algorithm is reasonably reliable: the number of the real change in industry leadership mostly lies in the 95% confidence interval generated by the simulation. Thus, it would seem that we can model the overall behavior of an economy by using a relatively low amount of data. To explain what happens specifically on a micro-level could either be disregarded or left to evolutionary theory to explain, which provides a number of options for the dynamics of a single company or within a group of actors. Sutton refers to “exogenous shocks to (relative) quality levels” to explain the development within an industry, which are assumed to occur randomly.

Based on the data from the Japanese database and his simulation model, Sutton determines that for some industries, a Markovian model (using nothing but the current status to predict changes) offers a sufficient approximation of reality, while for others, Chandlerian theory seems to offer an accurate approximation (Sutton 2007: 233ff.).

Sutton himself points out a number of limitations of his study (Sutton 2007: 236f.). Beyond these limitations, the premise of his statistical test may be questioned: is the number of industries that exhibit change of top ranking firms an appropriate test? In other words: if in the simulation the companies A, B, and C lose out to their main competitor, is that equivalent to companies D, E, and F losing out to their competitors in reality? Further, while Sutton intends his simulation to constitute a Markovian model, he does use a pool of observations of market share change to make predictions. This lends a lot of credibility to the unexpected findings in Figure 5, but the overall observation that a Monte Carlo simulation based on real data points coincides with the observed reality is not too surprising (law of large numbers).
