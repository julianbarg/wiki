* Rule-based behavior (in the BTOF sense) often lead to the actions.
* Six rationalizatoin tactics: (1) Denial of responsiblity, (2) Denial of injury, (3) Denial of victim, (4) Social weighting, (5) Appeal to higher loyalties, (6) Metaphor of the ledger
* Three socialization practices: **cooptation**, **incrementalism**, and **compromise**.
* Facilitating factors: (1) Group Attractiveness/Social Cocoon, (2) Mutual Support of Rationalization and Socialization, (3) Euphemistic Language.
