## One-paragraph summary
How do managers make decisions on their strategies? Porac and Baden-Fuller show that humans' limited cognitive capacity plays a divisive rules. Managers do not have all conceivable information available, instead, they have to purposely select a subset of information and collect these. The authors lay out that the most relevant information will stem from customers, suppliers, and producers, thus linking the mental models of these three groups' members with each other. As a result, between group-level structures and firm-level strategies, there are reciprocal links.

## One-page summary
Although Porac et al. (1989) does not specifically advertise this fact, the paper researches the microfoundations  competitive groups (and legitimacy as a member of such group). The paper describes the processes by which actors make decisions on their strategy. To describe this process, the paper builds on industrial organization literature from the likes of Porter (1980), institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell 1983), and cognitive work (Huff 1982). 

Porcal et al. (1989) explains that firm-level strategies are coupled with the environment through managers’ cognition. Because individuals’ ability to monitor the environment is limited, the outcomes of individual cognitive processes are limited also. Most importantly, managers have a perception of their business competing in a specific field (even if this might not be a deliberate decision). Hence, they monitor a certain subenvironment, not the world as a whole. Specifically, they make strategic choices as to where to market their goods, and receive market cues from customers, and suppliers.  They also monitor their competitors, or rather, those producers that they believe to be competitors. 

This process leads to a coupling of group-level and firm-level strategy. Although firms can act at their own accord, the coupling with the industry makes it likely that the firms still conform to similar strategies. 

On the individual level, the paper makes several assumptions on the processes that limited the interpretations that managers arrive at. They argue that when managers interpret cues from the environment, they rely on familiar cognitive structures (e.g., those that they have adopted from competitors). The paper also assumes the ability of individuals to verbalize their interpretation, and sometimes the process through which it was generated, and these interpretations are dispersed through the firms’ networks. Overall, this draws the picture of individuals, though able of agentic action, receiving similar cues and applying similar cognitive structures, thus arriving at similar results and constituting the institution. Most importantly the paper constructs a bi-directional model, somewhat resembling that from Rao (1994) where firm-level strategies feed into perception of industry of other actors, and thus still function self-reinforcing within the industry. 

In their empirical work, Porac et al. (1989) tracks the strategic decision making of the Scottish knitware industry. The paper shows empirically that the (cognitive) world of the industry is very small.
