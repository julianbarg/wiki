* Reform Environmentalists--p. 3
* "Despite agreeing with postmodern theory's critique of the dark consequenes of modernity's grand narratives, most counterculturalists still persist in exhibiting their own version of modernity's optimism. Hence, for example, many counterculturalists believe that humankind is evolving to a 'higher' consciousness that will mitigate not only personal problems, but social and ecological problems as well. Some counterculturalists articulate their evolutionary narratives in terms drawn from sources that most modernists would regard as 'irrational' and 'mystical'. Yet other counterculturalists seek to ground their views just as proponents of modernists have so often done: by appealing to the findings of contemporary science, especially the increasingly popular view that, despite important regularities, natural events involve an inherently unpredictable dimension that makes possible novelty, spontaneity, and even 'freedom'.
