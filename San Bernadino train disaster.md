## Summary

The San Bernadino train disaster was primarily that, a train disaster. The train derailment itself killed two, and two were seriously injured. The pipeline explosion occurred 13 days after the train derailment, killed another two, and three were seriously injured. The pipeline was later found to have (most likely) been damaged during the cleanup operations. The pipeline operator was found to not have adequately tested the pipeline prior to resuming operations.

## The spill

The train itself derailed on May 12. It crashed into multiple houses and destroyed seven of them. The spill occurred on May 25. A "geyser" of liquid shot up from the pipeline. Witnesses described white vapor and "white colored rain". A fire stood at four houses wide, extending 10 feet over the rooftops. One resident states that "the entire house [that she was in] was on fire" [@NTSB1990 p. 33]. Two residents burned to death. See also [[resources|San Bernadino train disaster.md#resources]].

## Cause analysis

In the section under and around the train incident, the pipeline was originally burried 8-8 feet deep. After the work had concluded (which included removing trona that had fallen of the train), the soil cover was 2-3 feet [@NTSB1990 p. 30] - which is after the soil covered had been smoothed out.

When the incident first occured, the operator noticed the "low suction pressure" alarm, but concluded that liquid levels in the storage tank must have occured for this to alarm to come on. He restarted the pump multiple times within a five minute window.

The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) later found (after another excavation) that the pipeline in the section of the train derailment "had not been completely exposed and visually examined for damage, that the structural integrity [...] had not been ascertained by Calnev" [@NTSB1990 pp. 35].

Visible scratch marks "nearly parallel to" the pipe rupture suggests that the pipeline had indeed been damaged by an excavator. Similar damage was found in multiple spots around the rupture point [@NTSB1990 p. 42].

## Aftermath

## PHMSA narrative

A southern pacific rairoad train derailed on May 12, 1989 at the site of the subsequent pipeline rupture.  The pipeline was shut down during the clean-up operations.  Clean-up was monitored by pipeline personnel and the pipeline excavated and inspected at several locations.  The line was restarted on May 16. On May 25, 1989, during stable pipeline operations, the pipeline ruptured spilling gasoline and causing a fire.

## Notes

* Company employees onsite on May 12 did not know how deep the pipeline was burried in the specific secion, or that it had a steel casing [@NTSB1990 p. ].
* Personnel tried to close a check valve in the pipeline by inducing backflow. When the valve did not close, they concluded that their method to induce backflow was not sufficient and they would not be able to induce backflow. In realilty, the check valve was faulty [@NTSB1990 p. 20].
* During the cleanup operations a lot of attention was paid to the pipeline. The involved personnel tailored the plan so that damage to the pipeline would be unlikely [@NTSB1990 p. 22. The pipeline was marked with paint, however, because heavy equiptment operated in the area, the paint would often be erased [@NTSB1990 p. 24].
* A Calnev representative was on site during cleanup operations.
* "According to Calnev's maintenance superintendent, it appeared that the debris had not penetrated the natural ground cover" [@NTSB1990 p. 25]. On the other hand, many pieces of equipment operated over a large area at the same time, so it would be difficulty to tell.
* Cranes crossed over the pipeline on May 15 and May 16. A calnev maintenance superintendent stated "I did not see any activity which I believed damaged the pipeline. Any time you are using large pieces of excavating type equipment nea a pipeline, you certainly have the potential for danger." [@NTSB1990 p. 25]. At the same time, no calculations of the stress were carried out.
* 80 feet of pipeline under the locomotive were excavated and inspected with no damages found [@NTSB1990 p. 26].
* When the spilled trona was removed, up to 12-16 inches of soil were also removed sometimes [@NTSB1990 p. 27].
* The personnel was not always exactly sure of the location of the pipeline (to the foot) [@NTSB 1990 p. 27].
* Where rail cars were found to have penetrated the ground, Calnev's maintanance superintendent marked the location for later inspection [@NTSB1990 p. 28].
* As early as May 15, Calnev's manager of operations stated to the fire chief that the pipeline would be safe to operate [@NTSB1990 p. 28].
* In some of the locations where the crash occured, the pipeline was burried at a peth of only 4 or 5 feet [@NTSB1990 p. 28]. Overall, the pipeline depth varied from 4-8 feet [@NTSB1990 p. 29]. After the work was concluded, the soil cover may have been 2-3 foot [@NTSB1990 p. 30].
* Equipment to inspect the pipeline could not be used because of the elevation. The operator would have had to bring the line to full operating pressure for the test to run. A hydrostatic test was not performed because Valnev's manager of operations had no "doubt as to the integrity of the pipeline" [@NTSB1990 p. 29].
* A potential situation where excevator operators could have penetrated the soil surface occured on May 17-19  [@NTSB1990 p. 30].
* "At least four pieces of railroad debris [...] were found near the rupture" [@NTSB1990 pp. 34f].
* After the incident, the pipeline near rupture was from 2-2.5 feet, whereas after cleanup operations it would have been 4.5-6 feet [@NTSB1990 pp. 35]. Either something happened, or somebody is not telling the truth. Conflicting information.
* After renewed excavation (after the pipeline spill), the PHMSA (previously OPS) determined that in its current state, the pipeline was "hazardous to life and property" [@NTSB1990 p.36].
* "Calnev's manager of operations testified that he was not aware that Calnev had ever inspected any of the check valves installed in the pipeline between the Colton pump station and Cajon Pass to determine if the valves operated properly. He further testified that it was his understanding that check valves are not routinely inpsected in the industry and that he was unaware of any Federal regulation or industry standards that required such inspection" [@NTSB1990 p. 55].

## Reponses

* Report really leaves you unsure whether to be horrified or amazed. Horrified because of the severity of the situation - heavy pieces strewn about and heavy equipment operating directly above a shalloly burried pipeline. Or amazed because of the care that went into avoiding damage to the pipeline, despite the fact that the heavy locomotive and train cars etc. had to be removed.
* Really makes you doubt whether every testimony is true, or whether a lot of if is just to avoid liability. Which is really generalizable - if in a situation with physical equipment in one specific location we cannot reliably gather the facts, then how would we do that for any metric for a larger organization?
* On the one hand, the situation seems quite clear-cut. If you do all kinds of bs above a pipeline, maybe really really make sure its not broken afterward. On the other hand, where is the line? Maybe if for some reason one piece of equipment passes over that would be alright? Should there be a rule to never pass over a pipeline? Certainly that would be too much.
* There are conflicting information. Either, events are missing from the report, or somebody is not telling the truth [e.g., @NTSB1990 p. 35 regarding soil cover depth].
* Something about negative (cathodic) voltage on p. 55 that I don't understand. Should probably ask somebody to figure out whether it is significant. Could this have indicated to Calnev that damage to the coating had occured?
