## Significance

### Learning

The incident (potentially) paved the way for wider acceptance of smart pigs for internal insepction of potentially damaged lines. The NTSB also continued its push for requiring liquid pipelines to adhere to the same regulations regarding new settlements being established near existing pipelines that are already in place for gas pipelines. Also, the report discusses check valves, and suggests regular maintenance (but only to Calnev).

#### Mechanisms

Learning could be concluded if:

1. Smart pigs were promoted (the use of a smart pigs did already pick up though, and did not prevent [[Olympic Pipe Line '99]] however). 
2. If regulation were passed that requires adjustment to the operation or rebuilding of existing liquid pipelines when people move into the area (as exist for gas pipelines). 
3. If regulations were changed to limit settlement near existing pipelines.

#### Outcomes

1. The maintenance of check valves could lead to a subsequent reduction of spill volumes.
2. The use of smart pigs could lead to a lower number of spills after external impacts such as train derailments.
3. Extended rules regarding liquid pipelines near residential areas could reduce the future number of fatalities and injuries resulting from pipeline spills.

### Other

Reveals the political rift between the NTSB and the DOT. The operator receives less attention, even though the spill could have been prevented, had the operator excavated and visually inspected the entirety of the impacted pipeline segment.

## Summary

The San Bernadino train disaster was primarily that, a train disaster. The train derailment on May 12 itself killed two, and two were seriously injured. The train and freight was removed by many pieces of heavy equipment, sometimes operating directly above the pipeline. The pipeline explosion that occurred on May 25, killed another two, and three were seriously injured. The pipeline was later found to have been damaged during the cleanup operations. The pipeline operator was found to not have adequately tested the pipeline prior to resuming operations. A check valve that would have limited the amount of commodity present in that section of the pipelien was stuck open.

## The spill

The train itself derailed on May 12. It crashed into multiple houses and destroyed seven of them. The spill occurred on May 25. A "geyser" of liquid shot up from the pipeline. Witnesses described white vapor and "white colored rain". A fire stood at four houses wide, extending 10 feet over the rooftops. One resident states that "the entire house [that she was in] was on fire" [@NTSB1990 p. 33]. Two residents burned to death. See also [[resources|San Bernadino train disaster.md#wittnesses-observations]].

## Cause analysis

After the train accident, the train was spewn about above the pipeline. Part of the removal of the train and transported freight was overseeen by Calnev, but not all of it. The pipeline had been damaged and was not inspected (neither with a smart pig, nor visually) before operation of the line was resumed. Unfortunately, after the construction of the pipeline in 1969-70, an area near the pipeline had been rezoned as residential and some housing had been constructed. Further, the pipelines check valves in the section were stuck open. The pipeline operated normally for a few days, before the leak occured. Because of the faulty check valves, a relatively large amount of RPP was released, and the nearby settlement largely burned down.

### What could have been done

#### To prevent the spill

Calnev could have either:
1. Excavated and inspected the whole pipeline
2. Performed a hydrostatic test
3. **Used an internal inspection instrument** 

* The last point refers to smart pigs, which picked up in popularity around the time. In 1988 it was required by law that all new and replaced pipelines were to be build in a fashion to allows for the use of smart pigs [@NTSB1990 p. 108]. However, smart pigs failed for instance to prevent the case of the Olympic Pipe Line spill in 1999 that killed 3.

#### To reduce the severity of the spill

* Further, Calnev could have inspected its check valves, which would have significantly reduced the severity of the damages  [@NTSB1990 pp. 109f].
* Local government could have opted not to open a site with a pipeline and railroad for residential development [@NTSB1990 p. 116].
* DOT could have issues regulations regarding pipeline sites where residential was established near an existing pipeline (which already existed for gas pipelines).

### Faulty parts/flawed procedures

* Pipeline segment damaged during cleanup of the train derailment.
* Check valves stuck open [@NTSB1990 p. 55, pp. 109f].
* No formal training procedures at Valnev for pipeline dispatcher [@NTSB1990 p. 64] - the individual that restarted the pipeline's pump after alarms came on - flexible, apprintice-like system [@NTSB1990 p. 31].

## Aftermath/learning

* A remotely operated block valve was installed in the area, so that the pipeline section near the settlement could be blocked off in the care of an emergency [@NTSB1990 p. 56]. There previously existed a check valve to prevent backflow, but the check valve did not close properly [@NTSB1990 p.55].
* The dispatch center terminal was modified so that if both low suction and low discharge occured at the same time, the system would automatically shut down the pump.  A corresponding section was added to the emergency response manual [@NTSB1990 p. 57].
* The emergency response manual (according to my reading) already had a section that adequately lays out how to respond to a train derailment. The chance of a train derailment is mentioned specifically. "[H]eavy equipment should not be allowed to operate over the pipeline if it is considered hazardous to the pipeline" [@NTSB1990 p. 57]. See also [[resources|San Bernadino train disaster.md#emergency-response-manual]].
* Risk assessment of hazardous liquid pipelines within 500 feet of a railroad truck was mandated by California  [@NTSB1990 p. 84].
* "[T]he board *believes* that Calnev should enhance the computerized operating system by requiring the dispatcher to acknowledge individually each alarm received"  [@NTSB1990 p. 109 - emphasis by this author].
* Safety Recommendation P-89-5, leading to an "alert bulleting to operators of all liquid pipeline operators *advising* them to test for proper closure all check valves in *critical locations*"  [@NTSB1990 p. 110 - emphasis by this author].
* The Transportation Department's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) "*initiatied a study* [...] to determine the feasibility of establishing inspection, maintenance, and test requirements [...] of check valves" [@NTSB1990 p. 113].
* NTSB urging for rules regarding residential development near pipelines (Safety Recommendations P-84-27, P-84-28, abd P-84-30).

## My reactions

* Report really leaves you unsure whether to be horrified or amazed. Horrified because of the severity of the situation - heavy pieces strewn about and heavy equipment operating directly above a shalloly burried pipeline. Or amazed because of the care that went into avoiding damage to the pipeline, despite the fact that the heavy locomotive and train cars etc. had to be removed.
* Really makes you doubt whether every testimony is true, or whether a lot of if is just to avoid liability. Which is really generalizable - if in a situation with physical equipment in one specific location we cannot reliably gather the facts, then how would we do that for any metric for a larger organization?
* On the one hand, the situation seems quite clear-cut. If you do all kinds of bs above a pipeline, maybe really really make sure its not broken afterward. On the other hand, where is the line? Maybe if for some reason one piece of equipment passes over that would be alright? Should there be a rule to never pass over a pipeline? Certainly that would be too much. The report lists 121 similar incidents where nothing happened.
* There are conflicting information. Either, events are missing from the report, or somebody is not telling the truth [e.g., @NTSB1990 p. 35 regarding soil cover depth].
* Something about negative (cathodic) voltage on p. 55 that I don't understand. Should probably ask somebody to figure out whether it is significant. Could this have indicated to Calnev that damage to the coating had occured?
* If regulations are passed regaring liquid pipelines and population density [@NTSB1990 pp. 113f], does this equate to learning? Or would that just equate to a redistribution of resources? I.e., cost for new construction, lower throughput in populated areas.
* Feud between NTSB and RSPA - e.g., "The Safety Board urges RSPA to objectively assess [...]". See also [[resources|San Bernadino train disaster.md#feud-between-ntsb-and-dot-s-research-and-special-programs-administration-rspa]].

## Various
* "potential adverse effects of train derailments" [@NTSB1990 p. 57]. Amazing language.

## Data

### PHMSA narrative

A southern pacific rairoad train derailed on May 12, 1989 at the site of the subsequent pipeline rupture.  The pipeline was shut down during the clean-up operations.  Clean-up was monitored by pipeline personnel and the pipeline excavated and inspected at several locations.  The line was restarted on May 16. On May 25, 1989, during stable pipeline operations, the pipeline ruptured spilling gasoline and causing a fire.

## Notes

* In the section under and around the train incident, the pipeline was originally burried 8-8 feet deep. After the work had concluded (which included removing trona that had fallen of the train), the soil cover was 2-3 feet [@NTSB1990 p. 30] - which is after the soil covered had been smoothed out.
* When the incident first occured, the operator noticed the "low suction pressure" alarm, but concluded that liquid levels in the storage tank must have occured for this to alarm to come on. He restarted the pump multiple times within a five minute window [@NTSB1990 p. 31].
* The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) later found (after another excavation) that the pipeline in the section of the train derailment "had not been completely exposed and visually examined for damage, that the structural integrity [...] had not been ascertained by Calnev" [@NTSB1990 pp. 35].
* Visible scratch marks "nearly parallel to" the pipe rupture suggests that the pipeline had indeed been damaged by an excavator. Similar damage was found in multiple spots around the rupture point [@NTSB1990 p. 42].

* Company employees onsite on May 12 did not know how deep the pipeline was burried in the specific secion, or that it had a steel casing [@NTSB1990 p. ].
* Personnel tried to close a check valve in the pipeline by inducing backflow. When the valve did not close, they concluded that their method to induce backflow was not sufficient and they would not be able to induce backflow. In realilty, the check valve was faulty [@NTSB1990 p. 20].[@NTSB1990 p. 
* During the cleanup operations a lot of attention was paid to the pipeline. The involved personnel tailored the plan so that damage to the pipeline would be unlikely [@NTSB1990 p. 22. The pipeline was marked with paint, however, because heavy equiptment operated in the area, the paint would often be erased [@NTSB1990 p. 24].
* A Calnev representative was on site during cleanup operations.
* "According to Calnev's maintenance superintendent, it appeared that the debris had not penetrated the natural ground cover" [@NTSB1990 p. 25]. On the other hand, many pieces of equipment operated over a large area at the same time, so it would be difficulty to tell.
* Cranes crossed over the pipeline on May 15 and May 16. A calnev maintenance superintendent stated "I did not see any activity which I believed damaged the pipeline. Any time you are using large pieces of excavating type equipment nea a pipeline, you certainly have the potential for danger." [@NTSB1990 p. 25]. At the same time, no calculations of the stress were carried out.
* 80 feet of pipeline under the locomotive were excavated and inspected with no damages found [@NTSB1990 p. 26].
* When the spilled trona was removed, up to 12-16 inches of soil were also removed sometimes [@NTSB1990 p. 27].
* The personnel was not always exactly sure of the location of the pipeline (to the foot) [@NTSB 1990 p. 27].
* Where rail cars were found to have penetrated the ground, Calnev's maintanance superintendent marked the location for later inspection [@NTSB1990 p. 28].
* As early as May 15, Calnev's manager of operations stated to the fire chief that the pipeline would be safe to operate [@NTSB1990 p. 28].
* In some of the locations where the crash occured, the pipeline was burried at a peth of only 4 or 5 feet [@NTSB1990 p. 28]. Overall, the pipeline depth varied from 4-8 feet [@NTSB1990 p. 29]. After the work was concluded, the soil cover may have been 2-3 foot [@NTSB1990 p. 30].
* Equipment to inspect the pipeline could not be used because of the elevation. The operator would have had to bring the line to full operating pressure for the test to run. A hydrostatic test was not performed because Valnev's manager of operations had no "doubt as to the integrity of the pipeline" [@NTSB1990 p. 29].
* A potential situation where excevator operators could have penetrated the soil surface occured on May 17-19  [@NTSB1990 p. 30].
* "At least four pieces of railroad debris [...] were found near the rupture" [@NTSB1990 pp. 34f].
* After the incident, the pipeline near rupture was from 2-2.5 feet, whereas after cleanup operations it would have been 4.5-6 feet [@NTSB1990 pp. 35]. Either something happened, or somebody is not telling the truth. Conflicting information.
* After renewed excavation (after the pipeline spill), the PHMSA (previously OPS) determined that in its current state, the pipeline was "hazardous to life and property" [@NTSB1990 p. 36].
* "Calnev's manager of operations testified that he was not aware that Calnev had ever inspected any of the check valves installed in the pipeline between the Colton pump station and Cajon Pass to determine if the valves operated properly. He further testified that it was his understanding that check valves are not routinely inpsected in the industry and that he was unaware of any Federal regulation or industry standards that required such inspection" [@NTSB1990 p. 55].
* Newer regulations did not apply to the pipeline, because it has been constructed before 1970 [@NTSB1990 p. 69].
* Provisions were created in a contract between the city and the railway operator that required the visual examination of the pipeline to the satisfaction of the fire department. The pipeline operator and fire department were not aware of this agreement however [@NTSB1990 pp. 80f].
* The report notes on incident where a train derailment led to a hole in a pipeline, and one incident where the operator was later required to uncover and inspect the pipeline. On the other hand, the report notes that it found 121 reports of train derailments over pipelines, where no damaged had occured if the pipeline was covered by at least 3 feet of soil [@NTSB1990 pp. 83f].
* A safety recommendation by the safety board issued a safety recommendation for the use of internal inspection equipment [@NTSB1990 p. 107].
* Before the accident, Calnev has not tested its check valves (which prevent backflow) for 19 years (since construction). In the other section of the report, a manager states that (he believes) it is not industry practice to test check valves. Upon testing three of the chack valves after the incident, Calnev found that all of them were stuck in de open position  [@NTSB1990 pp. 109]. 
* "Federal pipeline safety requirements for liquid pipelines do not properly protect public safety because they do not contain adequate requirements for the rapid detection and shutdown of failed pipelines and there are no provisions for safety enhancements when the population at risk increases. [@NTSB1990 p. 123]
