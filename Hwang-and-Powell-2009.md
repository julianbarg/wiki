## One-page summary

The paper analyzes the institutionalization of the non-profit sector, in that it evaluates the importance of professional values and practices on the rationalization of non-profit organizations. The article builds arguments starting from Professionalization paradox. There is a decline in the concrete occupations (law, medicine, etc.) and simultaneous increase in professionalization of everyone. The rise of education leads to rise of organizations, and rise of organizations has led to rise or organizational professionals, or the administrative class. The ubiquitous incorporation of experts into everyday organizational affairs has led to the rationalization of a wide array of domains. Professionals with competence in management are different from those with a cognitive base in a substantive field, as law, medicine, social work. For managerial professionals the pursuit of intelligence in organizations forms the basis of their authority. Extant research on organizational consequences of professionalization has tended to concentrate on specific areas, social services, social movement, health care etc., but has not looked at the fiels/sector in entirety. This paper looks at the non-profit as a sector in general.  

The context of the study is non-profits. The reason for selection of specific context is the move seen in non-profits where the routine work which was historically performed by part-time, volunteers is being moved to full-time paid employees. In recent decades, the non-profit sector has evolved from informal activities of charitable do-gooders to highly formalized endeavours by enterprising individuals. In such areas as health care, higher education, social services, and the arts, nonprofits are major service providers.  

The authors talk about five stages of professionalization, (1) the beginning of full-time work; (2) the establishment of a training school; (3) the formation of a professional association; (4) the 

protection of jurisdiction through state-sanctioned licensing; and (5) the development of a formal code of ethics. The stages move towards professionals from amateurs. Based on that, they posit the baseline hypothesis that with higher professionalization of the non-profit sector, the organization would tend to be more rationalized.   

**H1**: Non-profit organizations that are staffed and managed by paid personnel are associated with higher levels of organizational rationalization. 

The next set of hypotheses talk about various mechanisms that leads professionalism to influence rationalization. Hypotheses 2 and 3 talk about the role of training and education. Professional training that the non-profit senior managers undergo, and the credentialed professionals they hire, bring in the prevalent institutionalized norms with them which brings rationalization to the organization. 

**H2**: Non-profit organizations managed by an executive with a professional degree are associated with higher levels of organizational rationalization. 

**H3**: Non-profit organizations whose staff and leaders participate in professional training and development are associated with higher levels of organizational rationalization. 

**Hypothesis 4** distinguishes among the types of professionals in three categories, managerial professionals, semi-professionals and traditional professionals. The argument is the different cognitive bases for each of the professionals. The broad distinction being command and training in substantive disciplinary area vs expertise in general management knowledge. The traditional professionals are likely to be more orthodox and tightly bound to their normative orders, while as one moves away from traditional fields to semi-professionals (e.g. child psychologists, educators, etc.), to managerial professionals, they tend to experiment more, and are likely to bring institutionalized practices to the organization.  

**H4**: Non-profits directed by managerial professionals are associated with higher levels of organizational rationalization than non-profits led by semi-professionals; and non-profits managed by semi-professionals are associated with higher levels of organizational rationalization than non-profits led by traditional professionals. 

Finally, authors posit that in addition to professional training (H3), the managerial training is another mechanism through which the professionalism influences the rationalization at non-profits. 

**H5**: Non-profit organizations whose leaders and staff attend professional training and development workshops or conferences in managerial topics are associated with higher levels of organizational rationalization. 

In terms of methods, the authors employ quantitative methods using interviews conducted in 2003-04 of executive directors of 200 operating charities. The measure of Rationalization is measured in form of strategic planning, independent financial audits, quantitative program evaluation and consultants. For the baseline hypothesis the measure of organizational professionalism is constructed basis staffing (paid vs volunteer) and leadership (executive director, paid position and fulltime work). For other hypotheses the measures are in line with the extant constructs. The authors find support for all the five hypotheses.
