## One-page summary
Katila et al (2008) seek to understand power relationships from the perspective of the party that is assumed to be vulnerable: the entrepreneur. The authors pose the question: when do entrepreneurs choose partners with high potential for misappropriation over less risky partners? The tension that they focus on from the perspective of the entrepreneur concerns cooperation versus competition when selecting partners. Cooperation in the sense that entrepreneurs need valuable resources from partners, particularly in the start-up phase. These same entrepreneurs must balance this need against the potential of competition from their potential partners, a form of resource misappropriation. Partners may exploit their financial power over smaller entrepreneurs by leveraging an entrepreneurs’ technology for the benefit of the partner. The primary contributions made by the authors are in the context of bilateral extensions to resource dependence theory and the demonstration that entrepreneurs mobilize power in their own respect to counter misappropriation potential. 

### Construct Development and Hypotheses 
In evaluating power relationships from the perspective of the entrepreneur, the authors hypothesize on relationships where competition would be greatest with partners – corporate venture investors.  The dependent variable is, therefore, the likelihood of corporate venture investment in a particular funding round.  Resource dependence (cooperation) and defense mechanisms (averting exploitation power from partners) are hypothesized as predictors of the likelihood of corporate investments.  Broadly, the authors find that financial needs are the largest driver of cooperation and that entrepreneurs deploy defense mechanisms of delayed timing and trade secrets to counter misappropriation. 

The theoretical arguments arguing for resource dependence rely heavily on juxtaposing corporate venture investors against venture capital firms.  As such, the theoretical power relationship effectively involves 3 parties: the entrepreneur, the corporate venture investor, and the venture capital investor.  The arguments do not appear to fully capture the potential benefits that venture capitalists can provide, nor do they capture the threats posed by venture capitalists.  Venture capitalists do have access to resources that can be complementary (i.e. marketing expertise or manufacturing expertise); however, this argument is omitted.  Further, the major threat of venture capitalist to entrepreneurs is equity stake.  The likelihood of corporate partnerships later in the funding cycle may be confounded by an appeal for maintaining equity.  With these examples, the hypotheses appear to be undertheorized. 

### Empirical Testing and Coarseness of Measurement 
The logistic regression model and the Cox event history model leveraged focuses on the likelihood of corporate venture investment, leaving venture capital unobservable.  The dependent variable, therefore, does not appear to capture the full extent of the power relationships hypothesized.  Furthermore, the measures leveraged for predictor variables are coarse when considering the unit of analysis.  The unit of analysis is the funding round yet many of the measures are captured at the industry level (manufacturing need, marketing need, alliance intensity, patent defense, and trade secret defense).  An averaging out effect across the industry may render these measures irrelevant to the funding round (i.e. high manufacturing intensity in an industry may be the result of a few firms with high intensity and may not represent the industry well). 

Furthermore, the nonlinear nature of the model invalidates many of the interaction tests used to validate hypotheses around the integration of opposing forces of cooperation and competition or hierarchical defense mechanisms.  Each of these interaction effects only hold at particular values (mean centered) and may not be generalizable.  The support for hypotheses 6 and 7 may be overstated in this regard.  Processes study approaches may be a better indicator of hierarchical relationships versus regression models. 

Despite the challenges mentioned, the importance of the contribution should not be understated.  Examining power relationships from the side presumably at a disadvantage does uncover valuable extensions to resource dependence theory.  A more precise measurement of the constructs may yield stronger support for the conclusions reached by the authors; however, there does appear to be an indication that entrepreneurs exercise power in their own right suggesting a basis for future exploration on this topic.
