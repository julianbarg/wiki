Using quantitative data, show that learning is a more specific process than previously assumed. 

1. Existing theory would suggest that the pipeline industry, gathering experience with SCADA systems and smart pigs, should be able to continuously drive down instances & scope of pipeline spills.
2. But even pipeline spills are complex (more complex than previously assumed) and heterogeneous--almost no two spill are alike. Sweeping solutions do not apply, instead, lessons learned are highly specific.
3. In the manufacturing indstry, this distinction between conceptualization and reality is not that obvious, because there is less variation in work (this could be important to justify the relevance of my context)--but it still shows between generations of products.
4. In my context, we observe how the specific lessons learned may work--but the broad, sweeping ones do not, because they do not address problems (this might be different where new processes replace instead of augment old ones).
* Using qualitative & quantitative data, show how specific measures are introduced to solve specific problems
* Show how this use does not hold true for general progression of technology
5. Build a general model?

Could I do #4 with subgroups?
