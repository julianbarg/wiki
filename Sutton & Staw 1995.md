## One-paragraph summary

There is little agreement on what theory is, and trying to define it often creates more confusion. Here is what theory is not:

* "References Are Not Theory" (p. 372)
* "Data Are Not Theory" (p. 373)--mechanisms need to be explained
* "Lists of Variables or Constructs Are Not Theory [...]. A theory must also explain why variables or constructs come about or why they are connected" (p. 375).
* "Diagrams Are Not Theory [...]. [D]iagrams and figures should be considered as stage props rather than the performance itself" (p. 376).
* "Hypotheses (or Predictions) Are Not Theory [...]. They serve as a crucial bridge between theory and data [...]. Hypotheses do not (and should not) contain logigal arguments" (pp. 376f).

What theory does is explain the underlying processes of observed events. But there is also an argument to be made for a moratorium on theory, and a focus on "more descriptive narratives" (p. 378). The authors also display a concern about "hypocritical writing[, where] [t]heory is crafted around the data".
