## One-paragraph summary

@Maguire2013 analyse the discourse that ensues afer the passage of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The categorization of VAM as not toxic is associated with _normalizing_ practices or communications, while the categorizatin of BPA as toxic is associated with _problematizing_ practices or communications. The article shows that risk assessment is not a preexisting object to be discovered, but it is defined and managed by participants of the discourse.
