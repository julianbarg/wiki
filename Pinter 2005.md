## One-sentence summary

After the great flood of 1993, construction expanded greatly in floodplains. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) explicitely allows for this construction, and--by basing permits on the construciton of levees--gives the wrong impression that floods can actually be controlled. The "act of god" assumption does no longer hold, as construction in floodways, including erection of levees, has significantly increased the risk of floods. "Along the lower Missouri River and the Mississippi River near St. Louis, increases in flood levels of up to 3 to 4m during the past century have been documented" [@Pinter2005, 207].
