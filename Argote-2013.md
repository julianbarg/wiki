### 1. Organizational Learning Curves: An Overview

[[resources/Argote-2013-Fig-1-1.png|alt=Fig 1.1|width=500px]]

Introducing the learning curve as a starting point for the literature on organizational learning. The learning curve signifies the simple observation that with growing cumulative production, the unit cost tends to decrease. The learning curve is found to hold in many different contexts, but the learning rate varies significantly (p. 2). Argote differentiates the learning curve on different level (individual, group, organizational, interorganizational), of which the organizational level is studied in her book. Further, Argote (2013) traces the development of the learning curve literature: away from a focus on labor as well as away from an exclusive focus on the relationship between cumulative output on unit cost. Argote traces different topics that are studied in the literature. (1) A literature that expands outcome variables beyond unit cost, (2) a literature that studies the source of heterogeneity in learning rates, (3) organizational forgetting, and (4) and finally knowledge transfer.

## Thoughts
* **Knowledge transfer**: is it one of the keys to understand the effect of disruptions? Whether an organization can preserve knowledge throughout a disruption? From one "iteration" of an organization to the next.
