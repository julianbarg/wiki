### 1. Organizational Learning Curves: An Overview

[[resources/Argote-2013-Fig-1-1.png|alt=Fig 1.1|width=500px]]

Introducing the learning curve as a starting point for the literature on organizational learning. The learning curve signifies the simple observation that with growing cumulative production, the unit cost tends to decrease. The learning curve is found to hold in many different contexts, but the learning rate varies significantly (p. 2). Argote differentiates the learning curve on different level (individual, group, organizational, interorganizational), of which the organizational level is studied in her book. Further, Argote (2013) traces the development of the learning curve literature: away from a focus on labor as well as away from an exclusive focus on the relationship between cumulative output on unit cost. Argote traces different topics that are studied in the literature. (1) A literature that expands outcome variables beyond unit cost, (2) a literature that studies the source of heterogeneity in learning rates, (3) organizational forgetting, and (4) and finally knowledge transfer. As a summary (for point 2) Argote states that "[i]n our work, we have found that differences in organizations' abilities to retain and transfer knowledge are major contributors to differences observed in organizational learning rates.

#### Some important takeaways:

* Classic form of the learning curve: $y_i = ax^b_i$, where y is labor hours per unit, a is the labor hours for the first unit, and i is a time subscript.
* If one takes time as the DV to to measure experience, the result might be skewed, because of the external environment causing improvements. Cumulative production far better captures the experience that team members gather about their work, and about each other, when carrying out the work. Cumulative output has been found in the empirical literature to be a superior predictor of unit cost (ibid. 12). In practice, both may be included in a model.
* "There is often more variation across organizations producing the same product than within organizations producing different products. For example, there was more variation in productivity gains across World War II shipyards that produced the same ship than there was within the shipyards that produced different ships" (ibid., 17).
* "[M]any factors have been hypothesized to contribute to the productivity gains associated with increasing experience. The factors can be grouped into three general categories: increased proficiency of individuals, including managers, engineers and direct production workers; improvements in the organizationâ€™s technology; and improvements in its structure, routines and methods of coordination.
* According to Argote's description, the theoretical base to Learning is very thin (part 1.7).

## Thoughts
* **Knowledge transfer**: is it one of the keys to understand the effect of disruptions? Whether an organization can preserve knowledge throughout a disruption? From one "iteration" of an organization to the next.
